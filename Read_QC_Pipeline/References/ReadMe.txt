This References directory is a placeholder for downloading references and then preparing them for bmtagger.

1.) Go into the source directory and download the files that you want to use as a host contaminant reference screen.
  Look at the source/get_chrom.csh file to get an idea of what we're trying to put in this directory.
  
2.) Generate the indices.
  Look at the make_bmtagger_indices.csh file to see how to build the indices based on the files that we've downloaded 
  to in the source directory.

Don't check the reference files into the git repository!
