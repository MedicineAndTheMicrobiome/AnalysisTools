This References directory is a placeholder for downloading references and then preparing them for bmtagger.

1.) Go into the source directory and download the files, see if the csh file helps you, or not.  
2.) Next, generate the indices for srprism, see if the make_bmtagger_indices helps you or not.

Don't check the reference files into the git repository!
