=== Adapter 1 ===

Sequence: AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCT; Type: variable 5'/3'; Length: 58; Trimmed: 0 times.

=== Adapter 2 ===

Sequence: CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGATNNNNNNGTGACTGGAGTTCAGACGTGTGCTCTTCCGATCA; Type: variable 5'/3'; Length: 64; Trimmed: 1 times.
1 times, it overlapped the 5' end of a read
0 times, it overlapped the 3' end or was within the read
