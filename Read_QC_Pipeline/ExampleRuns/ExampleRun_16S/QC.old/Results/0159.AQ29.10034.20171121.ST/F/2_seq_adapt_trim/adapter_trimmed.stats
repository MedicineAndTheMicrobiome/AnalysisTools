=== Adapter 1 ===

Sequence: AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCT; Type: variable 5'/3'; Length: 58; Trimmed: 1 times.
1 times, it overlapped the 5' end of a read
0 times, it overlapped the 3' end or was within the read

No. of allowed errors:
0-9 bp: 0; 10-19 bp: 1; 20-29 bp: 2; 30-39 bp: 3; 40-49 bp: 4; 50-58 bp: 5
