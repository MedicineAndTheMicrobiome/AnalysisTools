Diversity indices, such as the Shannon diversity index, are unit-less and positively unbounded. They are also sensitive to the sequencing technology used and sequencing errors, so defining effect sizes in units of the diversity index are not meaningful since they cannot be interpreted universally.  Statistical definitions for effect sizes relative to the reference control’s variation provide a mechanism for calculating required sample sizes for power calculations.  Thus, we use Cohen’s eta^2 with threshold values of <0.02, ~0.13, and >0.26, for small, medium and large effect sizes, respectively.  With the pilot data consisting of n=40 individuals, Wilcoxon-rank sum tests were used to estimate the difference between cohorts, instead of a standard t-test, since the Shannon diversity index tends to be slightly skewed.  Based on computed tables, the smallest effect size (eta^2=0.065, change in diversity=0.26) would require n=37+37=74 total samples.  A medium effect size (eta^2=0.131, change in diversity=0.38) would require n=20+20=40 total samples.  A large effect size (eta^2=0.265, change in diversity=0.590) would require n=9+9=18 total samples.  The pilot data set had sample diversity measurements with median=2.86 and a 95% prediction interval=(1.65, 3.41).  Based on our previous experience, alternative diversity indices, such as the tail statistic, which is more sensitive towards lower abundance taxa have shown greater power.  In addition, linear regression models, including specific taxon abundance-based ALR regression methods, where a few covariates such as age and ethnicity are controlled for, play a significant role in improving sensitivity of in microbiome association studies, without significantly reducing error degrees of freedom.
