This directory contains tools for analyzing profiles in the form of Summary Tables.

Summary Tables are n x p matrices, where n (rows) are the number of samples and p (columns) are the number of categories.

The categories may be taxa, OTUs, functional categories such as E.C.s, PFams/TIGRFams, GO Functions/Processes, etc... 

Summary tables contain counts, which are often normalized prior to statistical analysis.
