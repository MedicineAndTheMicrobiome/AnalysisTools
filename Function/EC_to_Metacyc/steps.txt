First, if necessary, download the latest databases from MetaCyc.  You may need
to register.  You should expect the following:

    Databases:
    http://bioinformatics.ai.sri.com/ecocyc/dist/flatfiles-52983746/
    Username: biocyc-flatfiles
    Password: data-20541



1.) Extract_From_MetaCycDatabaseFiles 

	This will be necessary if the databases need to be updated.
Otherwise, you may reuse the extracted files froma previous run.

2.) Map_Read_toPathway_viaEC

	If you have reads already assigned to 1 or many EC's, then use
this script to assign EC's to a pathway.

3.) Pathway_toOntology

	Once potential pathways are assigned to each read, then assign
ontologies up the the root.

4.) Ontology_toCounts

	Once each read has multiple ontological assignments, count
up the number of hits per ontological category.
