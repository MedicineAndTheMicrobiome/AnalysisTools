CC  Members of this protein family are ABC transporter substrate-binding proteins associated with urea transport and metabolism. This protein is found in a conserved five-gene transport operon typically found adjacent to urease genes. It was shown in Cyanobacteria that disruption leads to the loss of high-affinity urea transport activity. Members of this protein family tend to have the twin-arginine signal for Sec-independent transport across the plasma membrane.
