CC  This HMM describes a very hydrophobic protein, predicted to span the membrane at least 8 times. The two members confirmed experimentally as glycerol-3-phosphate transporters, from E. coli and B. subtilis, share more than 50 % amino acid identity. Proteins of the hexose phosphate and phosphoglycerate transport systems are also quite similar.
