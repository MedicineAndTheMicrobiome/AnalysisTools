CC  This HMM represents a small family of proteins about 100 amino acids in length, including a predicted signal sequence and a perfectly conserved motif RAQPRD towards the C-terminus. Members are found in the Pseudomonas putida TOL plasmid pWW0 and in cryptic plasmid regions of Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhi and Pseudomonas syringae DC3000. The function is unknown.
