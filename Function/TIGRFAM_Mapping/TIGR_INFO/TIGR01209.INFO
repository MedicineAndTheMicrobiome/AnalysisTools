EN  RNA ligase, Pab1020 family
TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  Members of this family are found, so far, in a single copy per genome and largely in thermophiles, of which only Aquifex aeolicus is bacterial rather than archaeal. PSI-BLAST converges after a single iteration to the whole of this family and reveals no convincing similarity to any other protein. The member protein Pab1020 has been characterized as an RNA ligase with circularization activity.
