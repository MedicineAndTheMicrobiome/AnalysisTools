CC  Members of this family comprise the Firmicutes lineage endospore formation-specific sigma factor SigE, also called SpoIIGB and sigma-29. As characterized in Bacillus subtilis, this protein is synthesized as a precursor, specifically in the mother cell compartment, and must cleaved by the SpoIIGA protein to be made active.
