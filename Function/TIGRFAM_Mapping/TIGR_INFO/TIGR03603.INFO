CC  Members of this protein family include enzymes related to SagC, a protein involved in thiazole/oxazole cyclodehydration modifications during biosynthesis of streptolysin S in Streptococcus pyogenes from the protoxin polypeptide (product of the sagA gene). Recent evidence suggests that the YcaO/SagD-like component, not this component, performs an ATP-dependent cyclodehydration. This protein family serves as a marker for widely distributed prokaryotic systems for making a general class of heterocycle-containing bacteriocins. Note that this model does not find all possible examples of bacteriocin biosynthesis cyclodehydratases, an in particular misses the E. coli plasmid protein McbB of microcin B17 biosynthesis.
