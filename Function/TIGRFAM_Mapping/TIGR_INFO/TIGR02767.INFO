CC  This protein is found in the Agrobacterium tumefaciens Ti plasmid tra region responsible for conjugative transfer of the entire plasmid among Agrobacterium strains [1].  The protein is distantly related to the F-type conjugation system TraG protein.  Both of these systems are examples of type IV secretion systems.
