CC  This HMM describes a 54-residue domain found in the N-terminal region of plant proteins, the vast majority of which contain a ZF-HD class homeobox domain toward the C-terminus. The region between the two domains typically is rich in low complexity sequence. The companion ZF-HD homeobox domain is described in model TIGR01565.
