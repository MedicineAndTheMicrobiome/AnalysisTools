CC  Members of this rare protein family regularly occur next to a member of the MXAN_0977 subfamily (TIGR04039) of the di-heme cytochrome c peroxidase/MauG family (PF03150). MauG itself (TIGR03791) is a protein modification enzyme responsible for the tryptophan tryptophylquinone (TTQ) modification involved in methylamine dehydrogenase activation. All members of this family have a motif of four spaced invariant Cys residues, while additional homologs outside the scope of this family lack the four Cys residues.
