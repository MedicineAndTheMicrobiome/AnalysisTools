CC  Members of this family are bacterial proteins known or predicted to act as 2-methylcitrate dehydratase, an enzyme involved in the methylcitrate cycle of propionate catabolism. A related clade of archaeal proteins that may or may not be functionally equivalent is reserved for a future model and is excluded from this family. The PrpD enzyme of E. coli is responsible for the minor aconitase activity (AcnC) not accounted for by AcnA and AcnB.
