CC  This HMM describes a family of long proteins, over 1250 amino acids in length and present in the Proteobacteria. The degree of sequence similarity is low between sequences from different genera. Apparent membrane-spanning regions at the N-terminus and C-terminus suggest the protein is inserted into (or exported through) the membrane.
