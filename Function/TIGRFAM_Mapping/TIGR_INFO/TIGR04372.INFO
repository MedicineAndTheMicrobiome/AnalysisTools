CC  This domain occurs in proteins of various lengths, in contexts that include O-antigen biosynthesis regions of various Leptospira species. Below-cutoff scores to this HMM, and PSI-BLAST analysis, suggest distant sequence similarity to family 9 glycosyltransferases (PF01075), including ADP-heptose:LPS heptosyltransferase (RfaF), an enzyme involved in LPS inner core region biosynthesis.
