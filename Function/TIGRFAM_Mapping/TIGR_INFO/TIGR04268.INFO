CC  Members of this family are very short (~60 residue) polypeptides, among which the fifth and third to last residues are nearly always Phe and Ser, respectively. Because members occur in a conserved context with a putative peptide-modifying radical SAM/SPASM domain protein, we suggest that members of this family may be the modification target. The gene symbol fxsA reflects both the FXA motif and the proposed role as a ribosomal natural product.
