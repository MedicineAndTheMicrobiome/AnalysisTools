CC  This model describes the P-type ATPase responsible for translocating calcium ions across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane of eukaryotes [1], and is of particular importance in the sarcoplasmic reticulum of skeletal and cardiac muscle in vertebrates [2]. These pumps transfer Ca2+ from the cytoplasm to the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum.  In humans and mice, at least, there are multiple isoforms of the SERCA pump with overlapping but not redundant functions. Defects in SERCA isoforms are associated with diseases in humans [3].
CC  The calcium P-type ATPases have been characterized as Type IIA based on a phylogenetic analysis which distinguishes this group from the Type IIB PMCA calcium pump [4] modelled by TIGR01517.  A separate analysis divides Type IIA into sub-types, SERCA and PMR1 [5] the latter of which is modelled by TIGR01522.
