CC  Members of this family are found so far only in one archaeal species, Archaeoglobus fulgidus, and in two related bacterial species, Haemophilus influenzae and Escherichia coli. It has 9 GES predicted transmembrane regions at conserved locations in all members. These proteins have a molecular weight of approximately 35 to 38 kDa.
