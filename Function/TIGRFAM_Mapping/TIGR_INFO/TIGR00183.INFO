CC  Several NAD- or NADP-dependent dehydrogenases, including 3-isopropylmalate dehydrogenase, tartrate dehydrogenase, and the multimeric forms of isocitrate dehydrogenase, share a nucleotide binding domain unrelated to that of lactate dehydrogenase and its homologs. These enzymes dehydrogenate their substates at a H-C-OH site adjacent to a H-C-COOH site; 
CC  Prokaryotic NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenases resemble their NAD-dependent counterparts and 3-isopropylmalate dehydrogenase (an NAD-dependent enzyme) more closely than they resemble eukaryotic NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenases.
