CC  This model represents an uncharacterized domain of about 300 amino acids with homology to S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferases. Proteins with this domain are exclusively fungal. A few, such as EasF from Neotyphodium lolii, are associated with the biosynthesis of ergot alkaloids, a class of fungal secondary metabolites. EasF may, in fact, be the AdoMet:dimethylallyltryptophan N-methyltransferase, the enzyme that follows tryptophan dimethylallyltransferase (DMATS) in ergot alkaloid biosynthesis. Several other members of this family, including mug158 (meiotically up-regulated gene 158 protein) from Schizosaccharomyces pombe, contain an additional uncharacterized domain DUF323 (PF03781).
