CC  This model describes the subunit IV of the cytochrome b6/f complex. The cyt b6/f complex is central to the functions of the oxygenic phosynthetic electron transport in cyanobacteria and its equivalents in algae and higher plants. Energetically, on the redox scale the cytb6/f complex is placed below the other components - Q(A); Q(B) of the photosystem II in the Z-scheme, along the pathway of the electron transport. The complex is made of the following subunits: cytochrome f; cytochrome b6; Rieske 2Fe-2S; and subunits IV; V; VI; VII. Subunit IV is one of the principal subunits for the binding of the redox prosthetic groups. Each monomer of the complex contains a molecule of chlorophyll a and beta-carotene.
