CC  This model describes methymalonyl-CoA decarboxylase aplha subunit in archaea and bacteria. Metylmalonyl-CoA decarboxylase Na+ pump is a representative of a class of Na+ transport decarboxylases that couples the energy derived by decarboxylation of carboxylic acid substrates to drive the extrusion of Na+ ion across the membrane.
