CC  This protein is designated Asp3 because, along with SecY2, SecA2, and other proteins it is part of the accessory Sec system. The system is involved in the export of serine-rich glycoproteins important for virulence in a number of Gram-positive species, including Streptococcus gordonii and Staphylococcus aureus. This protein family is assigned to transport rather than glycosylation function, but the specific molecular role is unknown.
