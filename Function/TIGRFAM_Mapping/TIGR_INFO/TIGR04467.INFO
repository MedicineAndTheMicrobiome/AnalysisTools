CC  Members of this family synthesize cytosylglucuronate (or hydroxymethylcytosylglucuronate) from UDP-glucuronate and free cytosine (or hydroxymethylcytosine). This reaction is followed by a decarboxylation at C5 of the glucoside residue. The net reaction makes the pyranoside core moiety of a class of peptidyl nucleoside antibiotics.
