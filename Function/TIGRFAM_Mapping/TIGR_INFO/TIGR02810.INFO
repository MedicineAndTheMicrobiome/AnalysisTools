CC  Aldolases specific for D-tagatose-bisphosphate occur in distinct pathways in Escherichia coli and other bacteria, one for the degradation of galactitol (formerly dulcitol) and one for degradation of N-acetyl-galactosamine and D-galactosamine. This family represents a protein of both systems that behaves as a non-catalytic subunit of D-tagatose-bisphosphate aldolase, required both for full activity and for good stability of the aldolase. Note that members of this protein family appear in public databases annotated as putative tagatose 6-phosphate kinases, possibly in error.
