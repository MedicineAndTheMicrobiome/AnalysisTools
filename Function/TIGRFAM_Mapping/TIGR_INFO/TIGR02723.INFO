CC  Members of this protein family are the alpha subunit of phenylphosphate carboxylase. Phenol (methyl-benzene) is converted to phenylphosphate, then para-carboxylated by this four-subunit enzyme, with the release of phosphate, to 4-hydroxybenzoate. The enzyme contains neither biotin nor thiamin pyrophosphate. This alpha subunit is homologous to the beta subunit and, more broadly, to UbiD family decarboxylases.
