CC  MenG is a generic term for a methyltransferase that catalyzes the last step in menaquinone biosynthesis; the exact enzymatic activity differs for different MenG because the menaquinone differ in their prenoid side chains in different species. Members of this MenG protein family are 2-heptaprenyl-1,4-naphthoquinone methyltransferase, and are found together in operons with the two subunits of the heptaprenyl diphosphate synthase in Bacillus subtilis and related species.
