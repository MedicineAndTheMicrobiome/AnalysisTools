CC  Flavodoxins are small redox-active proteins with a flavin mononucleotide (FMN) prosthetic group. They can act in nitrogen fixation by nitrogenase, in sulfite reduction, and light-dependent NADP+ reduction in during photosynthesis, among other roles. This model describes the long chain type, typical for nitrogen fixation but associated with pyruvate formate-lyase activation and cobalamin-dependent methionine synthase activity in E. coli.
