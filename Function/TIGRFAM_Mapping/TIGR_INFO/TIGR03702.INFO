CC  Members of this protein family are designated YegS, an apparent lipid kinase family in the Proteobacteria. Bakali, et al. report phosphatidylglycerol kinase activity for the member from Escherichia coli, but refrain from calling that activity synonymous with its biological role. Note that a broader, subfamily-type model (TIGR00147), includes this family but also multiple paralogs in some species and varied functions.
