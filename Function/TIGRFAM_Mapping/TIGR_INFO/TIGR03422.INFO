CC  Frataxin is a mitochondrial protein, mutation of which leads to the disease Friedreich's ataxia. Its orthologs are widely distributed in the bacteria, associated with the ISC system for iron-sulfur cluster assembly, and designated CyaY. This exception-type model allows those examples of frataxin per se that score above the trusted cutoff to the CyaY equivalog-type model (TIGR03421) to be named appropriately.
