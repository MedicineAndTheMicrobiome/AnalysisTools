CC  This hypothetical equivalog is a member of the Class IIA subfamily of the haloacid dehalogenase superfamily of aspartate-nucleophile hydrolases.  The sequences modelled by this equivalog are all gram positive (low-GC) bacteria.  Sequences found in this HMM are annotated variously as related to NagD or 4-nitrophenyl phosphatase, and this hypothetical equivalog, of all of those within the Class IIA subfamily, is most closely related to the E. coli NagD enzyme and the PGP_euk equivalog (TIGR01452).  However, there is presently no evidence that this hypothetical equivalog has the same function of either those.
