CC  This model represents bacterial forms of DnaJ, part of the DnaK-DnaJ-GrpE chaperone system. The three components typically are encoded by consecutive genes. DnaJ homologs occur in many genomes, typically not near DnaK and GrpE-like genes; most such genes are not included by this family. Eukaryotic (mitochondrial and chloroplast) forms are not included in the scope of this family.
