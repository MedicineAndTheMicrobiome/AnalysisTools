CC  This HMM represents a small group of metazoan sequences.  The sequences from mouse are annotated as Pyrimidine 5'-nucleotidases, aparrently in reference to HSPC233, the human homolog.  However, no such annotation can currently be found for this gene.
CC  This group of sequences was found during searches for members of the haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily.  All of the conserved catalytic motifs [1] are found.  The placement of the variable domain between motifs 1 and 2 indicates membership in subfamily I of the superfamily, but these sequences are sufficiently different from any of the branches (IA, TIGR01493, TIGR01509, TIGR01549; IB, TIGR01488; IC, TIGR01494; ID, TIGR01658; IF TIGR01545) of that subfamily as to constitute a separate branch to now be called IE.  Considering that the closest identifiable hit outside of the noise range is to a phosphoserine phosphatase, this group may be considered to be most closely allied to subfamily IB.
