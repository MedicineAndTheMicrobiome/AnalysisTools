CC  The 2-methylcitrate cycle is one of at least five degradation pathways for propionate via propionyl-CoA. Degradation of propionate toward pyruvate consumes oxaloacetate and releases succinate. Oxidation of succinate back into oxaloacetate by the TCA cycle makes the 2-methylcitrate pathway a cycle. This family consists of PrpF, an incompletely characterized protein that appears to be an essential accessory protein for the Fe/S-dependent 2-methylisocitrate dehydratase AcnD (TIGR02333). This protein is related to but distinct from FldA (part of Pfam family PF04303), a putative fluorene degradation protein of Sphingomonas sp. LB126.
