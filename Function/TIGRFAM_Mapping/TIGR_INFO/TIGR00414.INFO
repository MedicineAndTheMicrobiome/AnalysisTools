CC  This HMM represents the seryl-tRNA synthetase found in most organisms. This protein is a class II tRNA synthetase, and is recognized by the pfam HMM tRNA-synt_2b. The seryl-tRNA synthetases of two archaeal species, Methanococcus jannaschii and Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum, differ considerably and are included in a different model.
