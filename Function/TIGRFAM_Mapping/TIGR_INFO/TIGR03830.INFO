CC  This model describes a family of predicted regulatory proteins with a conserved zinc finger/HTH architecture. The amino-terminal region contains a novel domain, featuring two CXXC motifs and occuring in a number of small bacterial proteins as well as in the present family. The carboxyl-terminal region consists of a helix-turn-helix domain, modeled by PF01381. The predicted function is DNA binding and transcriptional regulation.
