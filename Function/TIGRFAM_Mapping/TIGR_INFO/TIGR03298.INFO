CC  ArgP used to be known as IciA. ArgP is a positive regulator of argK. It is a negative autoregulator in presence of arginine.  It competes with DnaA for oriC iteron (13-mer) binding. It activates dnaA and nrd transcription. It has been demonstrated to be part of the pho regulon (PMID:10589831). ArgP mutants convey canavanine (an L-arginine structural homolog) sensitivity (PMID: 15150242).
