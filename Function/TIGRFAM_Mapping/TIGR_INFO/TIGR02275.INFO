CC  Proteins in this family belong to the AMP-binding enzyme family (PF00501). Members activate 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate (DHB) by ligation of AMP from ATP with the release of pyrophosphate; many are involved in synthesis of siderophores such as enterobactin, vibriobactin, vulnibactin, etc. The most closely related proteine believed to differ in function activates salicylate rather than DHB.
