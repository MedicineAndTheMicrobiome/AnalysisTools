CC  Glyoxylate carboligase, also called tartronate-semialdehyde synthase, releases CO2 while synthesizing a single molecule of tartronate semialdehyde from two molecules of glyoxylate. It is a thiamine pyrophosphate-dependent enzyme, closely related in sequence to the large subunit of acetolactate synthase. In the D-glycerate pathway, part of allantoin degradation in the Enterobacteriaceae, tartronate semialdehyde is converted to D-glycerate and then 3-phosphoglycerate, a product of glycolysis and entry point in the general metabolism.
