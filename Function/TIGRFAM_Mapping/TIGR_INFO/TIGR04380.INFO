CC  All members of the seed alignment for this model are known or predicted inositol 2-dehydrogenase sequences co-clustered with other enzymes for catabolism of myo-inositol or closely related compounds. Inositol 2-dehydrogenase catalyzes the first step in inositol catabolism. Members of this family may vary somewhat in their ranges of acceptable substrates and some may act on analogs to myo-inositol rather than myo-inositol per se.
