CC  This model describes most members of the family of Cas2, one of the first four protein families found to mark prokaryotic genomes that contain multiple CRISPR elements. CRISPR systems protect against invasive nucleic acid sequences, including phage. Cas2 proteins have been characterized as either endoribonuclease (for ssRNA) or endodeoxyribonuclease (for dsDNA), depending on the system to which the Cas2 belongs. CRISPR is an acronym for Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats. The cas genes usually are found near the repeats. A distinct branch of the Cas2 family shows a very low level of sequence identity and is modeled by TIGR01873 instead of by this HMM (TIGR01573).
