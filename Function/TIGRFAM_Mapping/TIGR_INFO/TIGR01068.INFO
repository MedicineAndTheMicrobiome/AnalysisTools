CC  Several proteins, such as protein disulfide isomerase, have two or more copies of a domain closely related to thioredoxin. This model is designed to recognize authentic thioredoxin, a small protein that should be hit exactly once by this HMM. Any protein that hits once with a score greater than the second (per domain) trusted cutoff may be taken as thioredoxin.
