CC  This homolog of dihydroxy-acid dehydratases has an odd, sparse  distribution. Members are found in two Acidobacteria, two Planctomycetes, Bacillus clausii KSM-K16, and (in two copies each) in strains K12-MG1655 and W3110 of Escherichia coli. The local context is not well conserved, but a few members are adjacent to homologs of the gluconate:H+ symporter (see TIGR00791).
