CC  Members of this protein are L-seryl-tRNA(Sec) kinase. This enzyme is part of a two-step pathway in Eukaryota and Archaea for performing selenocysteine biosynthesis by changing serine misacylated on selenocysteine-tRNA to selenocysteine. This enzyme performs the first step, phosphorylation of the OH group of the serine side chain. This family represents archaeal proteins with this activity.
