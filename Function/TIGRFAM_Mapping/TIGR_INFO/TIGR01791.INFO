CC  This model represents a clade of archaeal chorismate mutases.  Chorismate mutase catalyzes the conversion of chorismate into prephenate which is subsequently converted into either phenylalanine or tyrosine.  In Sulfolobus this gene is found as a fusion with prephenate dehydrogenase (although the non-TIGR annotation contains a typographical error indicating it as a dehydratase OMNI|NTL02SS0274) which is the next enzyme in the tyrosine biosynthesis pathway.  The Archaeoglobus gene contains an N-terminal prephenate dehydrogenase domain and a C-terminal prephenate dehydratase domain followed by a regulatory amino acid-binding ACT domain.  The Thermoplasma volcanium gene is adjacent to prephenate dehydratase.
