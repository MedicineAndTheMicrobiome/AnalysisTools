CC  Members of this protein family are commonly found next to markers of rRNA processing such as YbeY. They are extremely lineage-restricted, in the Planctomycetes and Chlamydiae/Verrucomicrobia group. Since classification is based on rRNA molecular phylogeny, this provides additional support for a role in rRNA metabolism. This small protein, about 50 amino acids in length, is rich in basic residues, a third line of support for rRNA interaction.
