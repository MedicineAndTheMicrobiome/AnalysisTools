CC  Phosphonates are a class of compound analogous to organic phosphates, but in which the C-O-P linkage is replaced by a direct, stable C-P bond. Some bacteria can utilize phosphonates as a source of phosphorus. This family consists of permease proteins of known or predicted phosphonate ABC transporters.  Often this protein is found as a duplicated pair, occasionally as a fused pair.  Certain "second" copies score in between the trusted and noise cutoff and should be considered true hits (by context).
