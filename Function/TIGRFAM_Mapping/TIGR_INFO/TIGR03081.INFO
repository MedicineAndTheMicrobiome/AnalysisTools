CC  Members of this protein family are the enzyme methylmalonyl-CoA epimerase (EC 5.1.99.1), also called methylmalonyl-CoA racemase. This enzyme converts (2R)-methylmalonyl-CoA to (2S)-methylmalonyl-CoA, which is then a substrate for methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (TIGR00642). It is known in bacteria, archaea, and as a mitochondrial protein in animals. It is closely related to lactoylglutathione lyase (TIGR00068), which is also called glyoxylase I, and is also a homodimer.
