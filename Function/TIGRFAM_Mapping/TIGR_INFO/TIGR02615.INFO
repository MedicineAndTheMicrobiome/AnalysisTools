CC  This model represents an exception within the members of the FtsW model TIGR02614. This exception occurs only in endospore-forming genera such as Bacillus, Geobacillus, and Oceanobacillus. Like FtsW, members are found in a peptidoglycan operon context, but in these genera they part of a larger set of paralogs (not just the pair FtsW and RodA) and are required specifically for sporulation, not for viability.
