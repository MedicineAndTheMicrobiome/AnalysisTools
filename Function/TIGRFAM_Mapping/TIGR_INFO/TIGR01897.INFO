CC  CRISPR is a term for Clustered, Regularly Interspaced Short Palidromic Repeats. A number of protein families appear only in association with these repeats and are designated Cas (CRISPR-Associated) proteins. This HMM describes a Cas protein about 400 residues in length, found mostly in the Archaea but also in Aquifex.
