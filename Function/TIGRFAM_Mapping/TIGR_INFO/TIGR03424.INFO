CC  A number of bacteria degrade urea as a nitrogen source by the urea carboxylase/allophanate hydrolase pathway, which uses biotin and consumes ATP, rather than my means of the nickel-dependent enzyme urease. This model represents one of a pair of homologous, tandem uncharacterized genes found together with the urea carboxylase and allophanate hydrolase genes.
