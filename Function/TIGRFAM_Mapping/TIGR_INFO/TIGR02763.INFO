EN  chlamydiaphage internal scaffolding protein
TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  Members of this protein family are encoded by genes in chlamydiaphage such as Chp2, viruses with around eight genes that infect obligately intracellular bacterial pathogens of the genus Chlamydia. This protein, initially designated VP3 (as if a structural protein of mature viral particles), is displaced from procapsids as DNA is packaged, and therefore is described as a scafolding protein.
