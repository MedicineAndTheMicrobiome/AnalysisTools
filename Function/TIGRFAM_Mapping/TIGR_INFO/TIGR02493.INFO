CC  An iron-sulfur protein with a radical-SAM domain (PF04055). A single glycine residue in EC 2.3.1.54, formate C-acetyltransferase (formate-pyruvate lyase), is oxidized to the corresponding radical by transfer of H from its CH2 to AdoMet with concomitant cleavage of the latter. The reaction requires Fe2+. The first stage is reduction of the AdoMet to give methionine and the 5'-deoxyadenosin-5-yl radical, which then abstracts a hydrogen radical from the glycine residue [1].
