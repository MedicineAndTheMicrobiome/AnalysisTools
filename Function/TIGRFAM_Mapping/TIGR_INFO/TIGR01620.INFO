CC  This model includes putative membrane proteins from alpha and gamma proteobacteria, each making up their own clade. The two clades have less than 25% identity between them. We could not find support for the assignment to the sequence from Brucella (OMNI|NTL01BM0951) of being a GTP-binding protein.
