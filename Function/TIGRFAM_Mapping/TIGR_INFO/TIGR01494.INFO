CC  The P-type ATPases are a large family of trans-membrane transporters acting on charged substances.  The distinguishing feature of the family is the formation of a phosphorylated intermediate (aspartyl-phosphate) during the course of the reaction.  Another common name for these enzymes is the E1-E2 ATPases based on the two isolable conformations: E1 (unphosphorylated) and E2 (phosphorylated).  Generally, P-type ATPases consist of only a single subunit encompassing the ATPase and ion translocation pathway, however, in the case of the potassium (TIGR01497) and sodium/potassium (TIGR01106) varieties, these functions are split between two subunits[5].  Additional small regulatory or stabilizing subunits may also exist in some forms.
CC  P-type ATPases are nearly ubiquitous in life and are found in numerous copies in higher organisms (at least 45 in Arabidopsis thaliana, for instance [1]).  Phylogenetic analyses have revealed that the P-type ATPase subfamily is divided up into groups based on substrate specificities [2] and this is represented in the various subfamily and equivalog models that have been made: IA (K+) TIGR01497, IB (heavy metals) TIGR01525, IIA1 (SERCA-type Ca++) TIGR01116, IIA2 (PMR1-type Ca++) TIGR01522, IIB (PMCA-type Ca++) TIGR01517, IIC (Na+/K+, H+/K+ antiporters) TIGR01106, IID (fungal-type Na+ and K+) TIGR01523, IIIA (H+) TIGR01647, IIIB (Mg++) TIGR01524, IV (phospholipid, flippase) TIGR01652 and V (unknown specificity) TIGR01657.
CC  The crystal structure of one calcium-pumping ATPase [4] and an analysis of the fold of the catalytic domain of the P-type ATPases [3] have been published.  These reveal that the catalytic core of these enzymes is a haloacid dehalogenase(HAD)-type aspartate-nucleophile hydrolase.  The location of the ATP-binding loop in between the first and second HAD conserved catalytic motifs defines these enzymes as members of subfamily I of the HAD superfamily (see also TIGR01493, TIGR01509, TIGR01549, TIGR01544 and TIGR01545).  Based on these classifications, the P-type ATPase _superfamily_ corresponds to the IC subfamily of the HAD superfamily.
