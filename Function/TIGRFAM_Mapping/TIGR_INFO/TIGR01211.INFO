CC  This family includes elongator complex protein 3 (ELP3) from eukaryotes and related proteins from other lineages. ELP3 is a component of the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme. It has an N-terminal radical SAM domain and C-terminal GNAT acetyltransferase domain. Members of this family are found in eukaryotes, archaea, and a few bacteria (e.g. Atopobium sp). The activity discovered first was an acetyltransferase modification at the N-termini of all four core histones, shown in vitro in eukaryotes. More recently, the radical SAM domain was shown to play a role in zygotic paternal genome demethylation. Family TIGR01212, widespread in prokaryotes, lacks the GNAT acetyltransferase domain but shares extensive sequence similarity with this family (TIGR01211).
