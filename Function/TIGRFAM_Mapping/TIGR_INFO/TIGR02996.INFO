CC  This model describes an abundant paralogous domain of Gemmata obscuriglobus UQM 2246, a member of the Planctomycetes. The domain also occurs, although rarely, in Myxococcus xanthus DK 1622 and related species. Most member proteins have extensive repeats similar to the leucine-rich repeat, or another repeat class or region of low-complexity sequence.  This domain is not repeated, and in Gemmata is usually found at the protein N-terminus.
