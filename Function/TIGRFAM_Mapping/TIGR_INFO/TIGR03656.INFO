CC  Isd proteins are iron-regulated surface proteins found in Bacillus, Staphylococcus and Listeria species and are responsible for heme scavenging from hemoproteins [1].  The IsdC protein consists of an N-terminal hydrophobic signal sequence, a central NEAT (NEAr Transporter, PF05031) domain which confers the ability to bind heme [2] and a C-terminal SrtB processing signal which targets the protein to the cell wall [3].  IsdC is believed to make a direct contact with, and transfer heme to, the heme-binding component (IsdE) of an ABC transporter in the cytoplasmic membrane, and to receive heme from other NEAT-containing heme-binding proteins also localized in the cell wall.
