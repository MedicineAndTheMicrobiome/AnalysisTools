CC  In a multiple sequence alignment of representative asparaginyl-tRNA synthetases (asnS), archaeal/eukaryotic type aspartyl-tRNA synthetases (aspS_arch), and bacterial type aspartyl-tRNA synthetases (aspS_bact), there is a striking similarity between asnS and aspS_arch in gap pattern and in sequence, and a striking divergence of aspS_bact. Consequently, a separate model was built for each of the three groups. This HMM, asnS, represents asparaginyl-tRNA synthetases from the three domains of life. Some species lack this enzyme and charge tRNA(asn) by misacylation with Asp, followed by transamidation of Asp to Asn.
