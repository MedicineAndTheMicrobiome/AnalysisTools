CC  Triosephosphate isomerase (tim/TPIA) is the glycolytic enzyme that catalyzes  the  reversible  interconversion  of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate. The active site of the enzyme is located between residues 240-258 of the model ([AV]-Y-E-P-[LIVM]-W-[SA]-I-G-T-[GK]) with E being the active site residue. There is a slight deviation from this sequence within the archeal members of this family.
