CC  The E. coli member of this family, YegS has been purified [1] and shown to have phosphatidylglycerol kinase activity. The member from M. tuberculosis, Rv2252, has diacylglycerol kinase activity. BmrU from B. subtilis is in an operon with multidrug efflux transporter Bmr, but is uncharacterized.
