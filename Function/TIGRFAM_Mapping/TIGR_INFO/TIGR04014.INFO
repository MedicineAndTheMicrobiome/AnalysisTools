TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  Members of this family have both a B12 binding homology domain (PF02310) and a radical SAM domain (PF04055), and occur only once per genome. This protein occurs so far only in methanogenic archaea. Some species with members of this family have a related protein with similar domain architecture (see TIGR04013).
