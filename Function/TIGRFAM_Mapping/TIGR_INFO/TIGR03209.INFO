CC  Clostridium botulinum neurotoxin production is regulated by a regulatory sigma-70 protein, BotR transcription regulator.  
CC  Similarly, tetanus toxin production of Clostridium tetani is regulated by TetR which is a very close relative of BotR. Both BotR and TetR are members of the TIGR02937 subfamily of sigma-70 RNA polymerase sigma factors.  Functional complementation experiments have been done for botR and tetR in highly transformable strain of Clostridium perfringens host cells to assess functional interchangeability of sigma factors and it has been confirmed that they are interchangeable in vivo [3].
