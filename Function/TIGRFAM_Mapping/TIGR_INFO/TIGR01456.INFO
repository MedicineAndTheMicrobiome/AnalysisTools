CC  This hypothetical equivalog is a member of the Class IIA subfamily of the haloacid dehalogenase superfamily of aspartate-nucleophile hydrolases.  The sequences modelled by this equivalog are all eukaryotes.
CC  One sequence (GP|13344995) is called "Cat Eye Syndrome critical region protein 5" (CECR5) [1].  This gene has been cloned from a pericentromere region of human chromosome 22 believed to be the location of the gene or genes responsible for Cat Eye Syndrome.  This is one of a number of candidate genes.
CC  The Schizosaccharomyces pombe sequence (EGAD|138276) is annotated as "phosphatidyl synthase," however this is due entirely to a C-terminal region of the protein (outside the region of similarity of this HMM) which is highly homologous to a family of CDP-alcohol phosphatidyltransferases. (Thus, the annotation of GP|4226073 from C. elegans as similar to phosphatidyl synthase, is a mistake as this gene does not contain the C-terminal portion).  The physical connection of the phosphatidyl synthase and the HAD-superfamily hydrolase domain in S. pombe may, however, be an important clue to the substrate for the hydrolases in this equivalog.
