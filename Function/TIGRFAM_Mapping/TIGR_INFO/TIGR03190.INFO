CC  Members of this family are the N subunit of one of two related types of four-subunit ATP-dependent benzoyl-CoA reductase. This enzyme system catalyzes the dearomatization of benzoyl-CoA, a common intermediate in pathways for the degradation for a number of different aromatic compounds, such as phenol and toluene.
