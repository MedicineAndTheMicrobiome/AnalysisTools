CC  4-oxalocrotonate tautomerase is a homohexamer in which each monomer is very small, at about 62 amino acids. Pro-1 of the mature protein serves as a general base. The enzyme functions in meta-cleavage pathways of aromatic hydrocarbon catabolism. Because several Arg residues located near the active site in the crystal structure of Pseudomonas putida are not conserved among all members of this family, because the literature describes a general role in the isomerization of beta,gamma-unsaturated enones to their alpha,beta-isomers, and because of the presence of fairly distantly related paralogs in Campylobacter jejuni, the family is regarded as not necessarily uniform in function.
