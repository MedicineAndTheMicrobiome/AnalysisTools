CC  This HMM describes a domain of about 40 residues with an invariant TQ dipeptide in an almost invariant TQxA[VI]W motif. This domain occurs in surface-expressed proteins of Gram-positive bacteria, many of which are anchored by LPXTG-containing sortase target domains. Numerous members of this family have domains PF05738 (Cna protein B-type domain) and PF08341 (fibronectin-binding protein signal sequence).
