CC  This HMM describes a family of proteins found exclusively in phage or in prophage regions of bacterial genomes, including the phage-like Rhodobacter capsulatus gene transfer agent, which packages DNA. Members of this family show some similarity to members of PF05135, a putative DNA packaging protein family.
