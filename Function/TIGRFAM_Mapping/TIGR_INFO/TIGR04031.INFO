CC  Members of this protein family show homology to the putative PaaH (or PaaB) subunit of the phenylacetate-CoA oxygenase complex. However, all members are found in the Halobacteriales in the vicinity of a radical SAM protein homologous to the PqqE protein of pyroquinoline quinone (PQQ) biosynthesis. Members are well-conserved to about residue 75, but then become low-complexity and hypervariable.
