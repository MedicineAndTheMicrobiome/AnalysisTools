CC  Bacterial PTS transporters transport and concomitantly phosphorylate their sugar substrates, and typically consist of multiple subunits or protein domains. The Fru family is a large and complex family which includes several sequenced fructose and mannitol-specific permeases as well as several putative PTS permeases of unknown specificities.The Fru family PTS systems typically have 3 domains, IIA, IIB and IIC, which may be found as 1 or more proteins. The fructose and mannitol transporters form separate phylogenetic clusters in this family. This family is specific for the IIC domain of the mannitol PTS transporters.
