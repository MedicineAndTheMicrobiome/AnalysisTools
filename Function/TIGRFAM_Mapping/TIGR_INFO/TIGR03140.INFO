CC  This enzyme is the partner of the peroxiredoxin (alkyl hydroperoxide reductase) AhpC which contains the peroxide-reactive cysteine.  AhpF contains the reductant (NAD(P)H) binding domain (PF00070) and presumably acts to resolve the disulfide which forms after oxidation of the active site cysteine in AphC [1].  This proteins contains two paired conserved cysteine motifs, CxxCP and CxHCDGP.
