CC  The member of this family from Rhodobacter sphaeroides has been shown both to form a complex with sigma(E) and to negatively regulate tetrapyrrole biosynthesis. This protein likely contains (at least) two distinct functional domains; several smaller homologs (excluded by the model) show homology only to the C-terminal, including a motif PxHxHxGxE.
