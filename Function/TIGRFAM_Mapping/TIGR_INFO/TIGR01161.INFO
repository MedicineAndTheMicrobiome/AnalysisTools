CC  Phosphoribosylaminoimidazole carboxylase is a fusion protein in plants and fungi, but consists of two non-interacting proteins in bacteria, PurK and PurE. This model represents PurK, N5-carboxyaminoimidazole ribonucleotide synthetase, which hydrolyzes ATP and converts AIR to N5-CAIR. PurE converts N5-CAIR to CAIR. In the presence of high concentrations of bicarbonate, PurE is reported able to convert AIR to CAIR directly and without ATP.
