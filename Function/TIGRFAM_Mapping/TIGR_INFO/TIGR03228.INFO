CC  Anthranilate (2-aminobenzoate) is an intermediate of tryptophan (Trp) biosynthesis and degradation. Members of this family are the large subunit of anthranilate 1,2-dioxygenase, which acts in Trp degradation by converting anthranilate to catechol. Closely related paralogs typically are the benzoate 1,2-dioxygenase large subunit, among the larger set of ring-hydroxylating dioxygenases.
