EN  PEP-CTERM family integral membrane protein
TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  Members of this protein family, found in eighteen genera so far, have a PEP-CTERM sequence at the carboxyl-terminus (see model TIGR02595), but are unusual among PEP-CTERM proteins in having multiple predicted transmembrane segments. The function is unknown.  It is proposed that an exosortase (see TIGR02602), recognizes and cleaves PEP-CTERM proteins in a manner analogous to the cleavage of LPXTG proteins by sortase (see Haft, et al., 2006). In at least six species, a gene encoding what appears to be a dedicated (single target) exosortase is adjacent. In that subset, the PEP-CTERM motif takes the form VPEPxxWxL.
