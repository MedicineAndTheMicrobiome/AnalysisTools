CC  Members of this protein family are uncharacterized. The only invariant residue, and one of three other residues better than 90 percent conserved are both Cys. Phylogenetic profiling results and occasional fusion genes suggest a role for members of this family in redox reactions or iron cluster metabolism. Species occasionally have two or three copies.
