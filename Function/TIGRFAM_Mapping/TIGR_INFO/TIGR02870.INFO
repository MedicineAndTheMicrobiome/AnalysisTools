CC  Stage II sporulation protein D (SpoIID) is a protein of the endospore formation program in a number of lineages in the Firmicutes (low-GC Gram-positive bacteria). It is expressed in the mother cell compartment, under control of Sigma-E. SpoIID, along with SpoIIM and SpoIIP, is one of three major proteins involved in engulfment of the forespore by the mother cell.
