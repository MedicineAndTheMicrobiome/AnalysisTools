CC  This HMM includes most members of the arginine-responsive transcriptional regulator family ArgR. This hexameric protein binds DNA at its amino end to repress arginine biosyntheis or activate arginine catabolism. Some species have several ArgR paralogs. In a neighbor-joining tree, some of these paralogous sequences show long branches and differ significantly in an otherwise well-conserved C-terminal region motif GT[VIL][AC]GDDT. These paralogs are excluded from the seed and score in the gray zone of this model, between trusted and noise cutoffs.
