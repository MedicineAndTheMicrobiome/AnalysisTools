CC  This enzyme, cyclohexa-1,5-dienecarbonyl-CoA hydratase, also called dienoyl-CoA hydratase, acts on the product of benzoyl-CoA reductase (EC 1.3.99.15). Benzoyl-CoA is a common intermediate in the degradation of many aromatic compounds, and this enzyme is part of an anaerobic pathway for dearomatization and degradation.
