CC  This model represents the phosphatase domain of the human
CC  RNA polymerase II subunit A C-terminal domain phosphatase (FCP1, [1]) and closely related phosphatases from eukaryotes including plants, fungi [2] and slime mold.  This domain is a member of the haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily by virtue of a conserved set of three catalytic motifs [3] and a conserved fold as predicted by PSIPRED.  The third motif in this family is distinctive (hhhhDDppphW).  This domain is classified as a "Class III" HAD, since there is no large "cap" domain found between motifs 1 and 2 or motifs 2 and 3 [4].
CC  This domain is related to domains found in the human NLI interacting factor-like phosphatases, and together both are detected by the Pfam model PF03031.
