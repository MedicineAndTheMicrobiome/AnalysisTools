CC  This HMM represents eukaryotic protein disulfide isomerases retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and closely related forms. Some members have been assigned alternative or additional functions such as prolyl 4-hydroxylase and dolichyl-diphosphooligosaccharide-protein glycotransferase.
CC  Members of this family have at least two protein-disulfide domains, each similar to thioredoxin but with the redox-active disulfide in the motif PWCGHCK, and an ER retention signal at the extreme C-terminus (KDEL, HDEL, and similar motifs).
