CC  This HMM represents the class I subfamily of poly(R)-hydroxyalkanoate synthases, which polymerizes hydroxyacyl-CoAs with three to five carbons in the hydroxyacyl backbone into aliphatic esters termed poly(R)-hydroxyalkanoic acids. These polymers accumulate as carbon and energy storage inclusions in many species and can amount to 90 percent of the dry weight of cell.

RT  PhaC and PhaR are required for polyhydroxyalkanoic acid synthase activity in Bacillus megaterium.
