CC  Members of this family are component II of the heterodimeric heptaprenyl diphosphate synthase. The trusted cutoff was set such that all members identified are encoded near to a recognizable gene for component I (in Pfam family PF07307). This enzyme acts in menaquinone-7 isoprenoid side chain biosynthesis.
