CC  This HMM describes a small family of proteins believed to aid in the export of various class II bacteriocins, which are ribosomally-synthesized, non-lantibiotic bacterial peptide antibiotics. Members of this family are found in operons for pediocin PA-1 from Pediococcus acidilactici and brochocin-C from Brochothrix campestris.
