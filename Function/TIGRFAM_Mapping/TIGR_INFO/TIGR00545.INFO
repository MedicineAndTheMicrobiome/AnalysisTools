CC  One member of this group of proteins is bovine lipoyltransferase, which transfers the lipoyl group from lipoyl-AMP to the specific Lys of lipoate-dependent enzymes. However, it does not first activate lipoic acid with ATP to create lipoyl-AMP and pyrophosphate. Another member of this group,  lipoate-protein ligase A from E. coli, catalyzes both the activation and the transfer of lipoate. Homology between the two is full-length, except for the bovine mitochondrial targeting signal, but is strongest toward the N-terminus.
