CC  Bacterial PTS transporters transport and concomitantly phosphorylate their sugar substrates, and typically consist of multiple subunits or protein domains. This family consists only of glucitol-specific transporters, and occur both in Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria.The system in E.Coli consists of a IIA protein, and a IIBC protein. This family is specific for the IIA component.
