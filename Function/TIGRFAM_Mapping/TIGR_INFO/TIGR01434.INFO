CC  Alternate name: gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase.
CC  This HMM represents glutamate--cysteine ligase, and enzyme in the biosynthesis of glutathione (GSH). GSH is one of several low molecular weight cysteine derivatives that can
CC  serve to protect against oxidative damage and participate in a biosynthetic or detoxification reactions.
Clostridium acetobutylicum candidate is short, is from an actinomycete (mycothione expected instead), and scores between trusted and noise.
