CC  Prolyl-tRNA synthetase is a class II tRNA synthetase and is recognized by pfam HMM tRNA-synt_2b, which recognizes tRNA synthetases for Gly, His, Ser, and Pro. The prolyl-tRNA synthetases are divided into two widely divergent groups. This group includes enzymes from Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Aquifex aeolicus, the spirochete Treponema pallidum, Synechocystis PCC6803, and one of the two prolyL-tRNA synthetases of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The other group includes the Pro-specific domain of a human multifunctional tRNA ligase and the prolyl-tRNA synthetases from the Archaea, the Mycoplasmas, and the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi.
