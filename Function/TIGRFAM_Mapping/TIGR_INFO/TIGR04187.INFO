CC  Members of this protein family are ATP-grasp ligase family enzymes that regularly occur in a contexts with a methyltransferase and a putative ribosomally translated post-translationally modified peptide precursor. Because of this conserved gene neighborhood and close sequence similarity to ATP-grasp enzymes from microviridin/marinostatin biosynthesis cassettes, this enzyme is suggested also to serve as a peptide maturase.
