CC  Members of this protein are the plasmid replication initiator RepA of incFII (plasmid incompatibility group F-II) plasmids. R1 and R100 are plasmids in this group. Immediately upstream of repA is found tap, a leader peptide of about 24 amino acids, often not assigned as a gene in annotated plasmid sequences. Note that other, non-homologous plasmid replication proteins share the gene symbol (repA) and similar names (plasmid replication protein RepA).
