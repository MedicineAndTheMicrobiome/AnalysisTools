CC  This protein through the member sll1638 from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, was shown to be part of the cyanobacteria photosystem II. It is homologous to (but quite diverged from) the chloroplast PsbQ protein, called oxygen-evolving enhancer protein 3 (OEE3). We designate this cyanobacteria protein PsbQ by homology.
