CC  This HMM describes a small family of uncharacterized proteins found so far in alpha and gamma proteobacteria and in Nostoc sp. PCC 7120, a cyanobacterium. The gene for this protein is associated with nitrogenase genes. This family shows sequence similarity to TIGR00014, a glutaredoxin-dependent arsenate reductase that converts arsentate to arsenite for disposal. This family is one of several included in Pfam model PF03960.
