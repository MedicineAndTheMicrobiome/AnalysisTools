CC  This largely uncharacterized protein family is assigned a role in nitrogen fixation by two criteria. First, its gene occurs, generally, among genes essential for expression of active nitrogenase. Second, its phylogenetic profile closely matches that of nitrogen-fixing bacteria. However, mutational studies in Klebsiella pneumoniae failed to demonstrate any phenotype for deletion or overexpression of the protein.
