CC  A biosynthesis cassette found in Syntrophobacter fumaroxidans MPOB, Chlorobium limicola DSM 245, Methanocella paludicola SANAE, and delta proteobacterium NaphS2 contains two PqqE-like radical SAM/SPASM domain proteins, a PqqD homolog, and a conserved hypothetical protein. These components suggest modification of a ribosomally produced peptide precursor, but the precursor has not been identified. Of the two PqqE homologs of the cassette, this family is the more distant in sequence.
