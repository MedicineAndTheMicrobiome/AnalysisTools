CC  Members of this protein family are the putative conjugative coupling factor, TraD (or TraG), rather distantly related to the well-characterized TraD of the F plasmid. Members are associated with conjugative-transposon-like mobile genetic elements of the class that includes SXT, an antibiotic resistance transfer element in some Vibrio cholerae strains.
