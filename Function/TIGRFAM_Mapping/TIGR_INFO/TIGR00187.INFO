CC  This protein family consists almost entirely of two lumazine-binding domains, described in the HMM Lum_binding from PFAM. The model generates lower scores against other proteins that also have two lumazine-binding domains, including some involved in bioluminescence.
CC  The name ribE was selected, from among alternatives including ribB and ribC, to match the usage in EcoCyc.
