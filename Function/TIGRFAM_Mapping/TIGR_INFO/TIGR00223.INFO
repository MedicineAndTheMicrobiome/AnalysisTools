CC  Members of this family are aspartate 1-decarboxylase, the enzyme that makes beta-alanine and C02 from aspartate. Beta-alanine is then used to make the vitamin pantothenate, from which coenzyme A is made. Aspartate 1-decarboxylase is synthesized as a proenzyme, then cleaved to an alpha (C-terminal) and beta (N-terminal) subunit with a pyruvoyl group.
