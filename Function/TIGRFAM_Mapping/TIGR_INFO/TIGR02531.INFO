EN  TrpR-related protein YerC/YecD
TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  This model represents a protein subfamily found mostly in the Firmicutes (Bacillus and allies). This family is similar in sequence to the trp operon repressor TrpR described by TIGR01321, and represents a distinct clade within the broader family described by PF01371. At least one species, Xylella fastidiosa, in the Proteobacteria, has a member of both this family and TIGR01321. Several genomes with a member of this family do not synthesize tryptophan, and members of this family should not be considered trp operon repressors without new evidence.
