CC  This model represents a heme b-binding subunit, typically called the gamma subunit, of various proteins that also contain a molybdopterin subunit and an iron-sulfur protein. The group includes two distinct but very closely related periplasmic proteins of anaerobic respiration, selenate reductase and chlorate reductase. Other members of this family include  dimethyl sulphide dehydrogenase and ethylbenzene dehydrogenase.
