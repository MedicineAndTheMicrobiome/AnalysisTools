CC  This enzyme carries out the first step in the degradation of allantoin, a ring-opening hydrolysis.  The seed members of this model are all in the vicinity of other genes involved in the processes of xanthine/urate/allantoin catabolism.  Although not included in the seed, many eukaryotic homologs of this family are included above the trusted cutoff.  Below the noise cutoff are related hydantoinases.
