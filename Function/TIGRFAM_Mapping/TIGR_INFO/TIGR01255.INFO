CC  Alternate names: pyruvate formate-lyase; formate C-acetyltransferase
CC  This enzyme converts formate + acetyl-CoA into pyruvate + CoA.
CC  This HMM describes formate acetyltransferase 1. More distantly related putative formate acetyltransferases have also been identified, including formate acetyltransferase 2 from E. coli, which is excluded from this model.
