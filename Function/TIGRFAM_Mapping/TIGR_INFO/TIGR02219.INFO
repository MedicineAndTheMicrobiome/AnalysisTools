CC  Members of this family show sequence similarity to members of the NlpC/P60 family described by Pfam model PF00877 and by  Anantharaman and Aravind (PMID:12620121). The NlpC/P60 family includes a number of characterized bacterial cell wall hydrolases. Members of this related family are all found in prophage regions of bacterial genomes.
