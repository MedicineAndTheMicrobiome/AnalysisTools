CC  The most conserved region in this protein family is the C-terminal pentapeptide, with motif ExLDI. Members from the Firmicutes average about 120 amino acids in length, while members from the Actinobacteria have an additional 45-residue amino-terminal segment not included in the model. In PMID:21756306 it is suggested that the member from Streptococcus mutans UA159, and its homologs, participate in bacteriocin production, export, or immunity.
