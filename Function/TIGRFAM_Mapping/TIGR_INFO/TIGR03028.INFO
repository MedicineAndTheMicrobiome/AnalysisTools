CC  Sequences in this family of proteins are members of a polysaccharide export protein family (PF02563) which includes the wza [1] protein from E.coli.  This family of proteins are homologous to the EpsE protein of the methanolan biosynthesis operon of Methylobacillus species strain 12S [2].  The distribution of this protein appears to be restricted to a subset of exopolysaccharide operons containing a syntenic grouping of genes including a variant of the EpsH exosortase protein [2].  Exosortase has been proposed to be involved in the targetting and processing of proteins containing the PEP-CTERM domain to the exopolysaccharide layer [3].
