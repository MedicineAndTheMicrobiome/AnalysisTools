CC  This model describes a family of cytochrome b proteins which appear to be specific for nickel-iron hydrogenase complexes.  Every genome which contains a member of this family posesses a Ni/Fe hydrogenase according to Genome Properties (GenProp0177), and most are gene clustered with other hydrogenase components.  Some Ni/Fe hydrogenase-containing species lack a member of this family but contain other CytB homologs (PF01292) which may substitute for it.
