CC  This model represents one of two non-homologous forms of aspartate--ammonia ligase (asparagine synthetase) found in E. coli. This type is also found in Haemophilus influenzae, Treponema pallidum and Lactobacillus delbrueckii, but appears to have a very limited distribution.
CC  The fact that the protein from the  H. influenzae is more than 70 % identical to that from the spirochete Treponema pallidum, but less than 65 % identical to that from the closely related E. coli, strongly suggests lateral transfer.
