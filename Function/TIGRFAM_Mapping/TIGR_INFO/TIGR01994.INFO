CC  Three iron-sulfur cluster assembly systems are known so far. ISC is broadly distributed while NIF tends to be associated with nitrogenase in nitrogen-fixing bacteria. The most recently described is SUF, believed to be important to maintain the function during aerobic stress of enzymes with labile Fe-S clusters. It is fairly widely distributed. This family represents one of two different proteins proposed to act as a scaffold on which the Fe-S cluster is built and from which it is transferred.
