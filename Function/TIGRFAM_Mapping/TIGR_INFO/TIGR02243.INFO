EN  putative baseplate assembly protein
TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  This family consists of a large, conserved hypothetical protein in phage tail-like regions of at least six bacterial genomes: Gloeobacter violaceus PCC 7421, Geobacter sulfurreducens PCA, Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2), Streptomyces avermitilis MA-4680, Mesorhizobium loti, and Myxococcus xanthus. The C-terminal region is identified by the broader model PF04865 as related to baseplate protein J from phage P2, but that relationship is not observed directly.
