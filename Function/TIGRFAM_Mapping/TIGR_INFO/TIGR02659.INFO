CC  This family consists of the light chain of methylamine dehydrogenase light chain, a periplasmic enzyme.  This subunit contains a tryptophan tryptophylquinone (TTQ) prothetic group derived from Trp-114 and Trp-165 of the precursor, numbered according to the sequence from Paracoccus denitrificans. The enzyme forms a complex with the type I blue copper protein amicyanin and cytochrome. Electron transfer procedes from TQQ to the copper and then to the heme group of the cytochrome.
