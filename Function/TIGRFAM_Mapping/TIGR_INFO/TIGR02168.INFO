EN  chromosome segregation protein SMC, common bacterial type
GS  smc
TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  SMC (structural maintenance of chromosomes) proteins bind DNA and act in organizing and segregating chromosomes for partition. SMC proteins are found in bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes. This family represents the SMC protein of most bacteria. The smc gene is often associated with scpB (TIGR00281) and scpA genes, where scp stands for segregation and condensation protein. SMC was shown (in Caulobacter crescentus) to be induced early in S phase but present and bound to DNA throughout the cell cycle.
