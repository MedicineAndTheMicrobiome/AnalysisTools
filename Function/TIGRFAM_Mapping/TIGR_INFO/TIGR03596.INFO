CC  Members of this protein family are GTP-binding proteins involved in ribosome biogenesis, including the essential YlqF protein of Bacillus subtilis, which is an essential protein. They are related to Era, EngA, and other GTPases of ribosome biogenesis, but are circularly permuted. This family is not universal, and is not present in Escherichia coli, and so is not as well studied as some other GTPases. This model is built for bacterial members.
