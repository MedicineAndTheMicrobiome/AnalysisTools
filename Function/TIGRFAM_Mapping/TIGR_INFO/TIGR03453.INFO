CC  Members of this family are the RepA (or ParA) protein involved in replicon partitioning. All known examples occur in bacterial species with two or more replicons, on a plasmid or the smaller chromosome. Note that an apparent exception may be seen as a pseudomolecule from assembly of an incompletely sequenced genome. Members of this family belong to a larger family that also includes the enzyme cobyrinic acid a,c-diamide synthase, but assignment of that name to members of this family would be in error.
