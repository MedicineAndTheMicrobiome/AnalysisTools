CC  This family consists of gentisate 1,2-dioxygenases. This ring-opening enzyme acts in salicylate degradation that goes via gentisate rather than via catechol. It converts gentisate to maleylpyruvate. Some putative gentisate 1,2-dioxygenases are excluded by a relatively high trusted cutoff score because they are too closely related to known examples of 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoate dioxygenase. Therefore some homologs may be bona fide gentisate 1,2-dioxygenases even if they score below the given cutoffs.
