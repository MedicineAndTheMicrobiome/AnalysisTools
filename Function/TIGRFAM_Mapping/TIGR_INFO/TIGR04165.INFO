CC  Members of this small peptide family occur strictly in a subset of archaeal methanogens. Members have four invariant Cys residues in two Cys-Xaa-Xaa-Cys-Gly motifs and may have other Cys residues as well. At least two members occur next to family TIGR04083 radical SAM enzymes predicted to act in peptide or protein modification.
