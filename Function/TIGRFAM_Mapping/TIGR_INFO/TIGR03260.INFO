CC  Members of this protein family are protein D, a non-structural  protein, of the operon for methyl coenzyme M reductase, also called coenzyme-B sulfoethylthiotransferase (EC 2.8.4.1). That enzyme, with alpha, beta, and gamma subunits, catalyzes the last step in methanogenesis; it has several modified sites, so accessory proteins are expected. Several methanogens have encode two such enzymes, designated I and II; this model does not separate the isozymes. Proteins in this family are expressed at much lower levels than the methyl-coenzyme M reductase itself and  associate and have been shown to form at least transient associations. The precise function is unknown.
