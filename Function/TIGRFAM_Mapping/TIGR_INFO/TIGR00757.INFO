CC  This model describes ribonuclease G (formerly CafA, cytoplasmic axial filament protein A), the N-terminal domain of ribonuclease E in which ribonuclease activity resides, and related proteins. In E. coli, both RNase E and RNase G have been shown to play a role in the maturation of the 5' end of 16S RNA.
CC  The C-terminal half of RNase E (excluded from the seed alignment for this model) lacks ribonuclease activity but participates in mRNA degradation by organizing the degradosome.
