CC  Sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS) and sucrose phosphate phosphatase (SPP) are the last two enzymes of sucrose biosynthesis. In cyanobacteria and plants, the C-terminal region of most or all versions of SPS has a domain homologous to the known SPP. This domain may serve a binding or regulatory rather than catalytic function. Sequences in this family are bacterial C-terminal regions found in all but two of the putative bacterial sucrose phosphate synthases described by TIGR02472.
