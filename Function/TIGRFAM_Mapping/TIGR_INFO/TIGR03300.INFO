CC  Members of this protein family are YfgL, a lipoprotein component of a complex that acts protein insertion into the bacterial outer membrane. Other members of this complex are NlpB, YfiO, and YaeT. This protein contains multiple copies of a repeat that, in other contexts, are associated with binding of the coenzyme PQQ.
