CC  Members of this family are probable protein/peptide-modifying radical SAM/SPASM domain proteins. The majority of members of this family seem to target Cys-rich repetitive regions of large proteins rather than of bacteriocin-sized small precursors. This arrangement suggests the modification target may be multifunctional, with the C-terminal domain behaving like a bacteriocin but other parts of the same precursor serving an immunity function, as occurs for the halocin C8 precursor.
