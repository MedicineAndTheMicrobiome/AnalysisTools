CC  This model describes and uncharacterized conserved hypothetical protein. Members are found with the C-terminal putative exosortase interaction domain, PEP-CTERM, in Nitrosospira multiformis, Rhodoferax ferrireducens, Solibacter usitatus Ellin6076, and Acidobacteria bacterium Ellin345. It is found without the PEP-CTERM domain in several other species, including Burkholderia ambifaria, Gloeobacter violaceus PCC 7421, and three copies in the Acanthamoeba polyphaga mimivirus.
