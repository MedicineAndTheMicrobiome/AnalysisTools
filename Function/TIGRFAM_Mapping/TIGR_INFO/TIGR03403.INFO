CC  Members of this family are the NifS-like cysteine desulfurase of the epsilon division of the Proteobacteria, similar to the NifS protein of nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Like NifS, and unlike IscS, this protein is found as part of a system of just two proteins, a cysteine desulfurase and a scaffold, for iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis. This protein is called NifS by Olsen, et al. (PMID:11123951), so we use this designation.
