CC  This model represents a sequence region shared between several proteins of Myxococcus xanthus DK 1622 and some eukaryotic proteins that include human pappalysin-1 (SP|Q13219). The region of about 40 amino acids contains several conserved Cys residues presumed to form disulfide bonds. The region appears in up to 13 repeats in Myxococcus.
