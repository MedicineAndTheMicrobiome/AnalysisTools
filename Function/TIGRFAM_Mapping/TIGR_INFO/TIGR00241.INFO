CC  This domain is found in a set of closely related proteins including the (R)-2-hydroxyglutaryl-CoA dehydratase activase of Acidaminococcus fermentans, in longer proteins from M. jannaschii and M. thermoautotrophicum that share an additional N-terminal domain, in a protein described as a subunit of the benzoyl-CoA reductase of Rhodopseudomonas palustris, and in two repeats of an uncharacterized protein of Aquifex aeolicus.
CC  This domain may be involved in generating or regenerating the active sites of enzymes related to (R)-2-hydroxyglutaryl-CoA dehydratase and benzoyl-CoA reductase.
