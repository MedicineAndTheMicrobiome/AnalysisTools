CC  This protein family originally was named SurE because of its role in stationary phase survivalin Escherichia coli. In E. coli, surE is next to pcm, an L-isoaspartyl protein repair methyltransferase that is also required for stationary phase survival. Recent work (PMID:15489502) shows that viewing SurE as an acid phosphatase (3.1.3.2) is not accurate. Rather, SurE in E. coli, Thermotoga maritima, and Pyrobaculum aerophilum acts strictly on nucleoside 5'- and 3'-monophosphates.
CC  E. coli SurE is Recommended cutoffs are 15 for homology, 40 for probable orthology, and 200 for orthology with full-length homology.
