CC  Members of this protein family belong by homology to the family of CoA transferases. However, the characterized member from Chloroflexus aurantiacus appears to perform an intramolecular transfer, making it an isomerase. The enzyme converts mesaconyl-C1-CoA to mesaconyl-C4-CoA as part of the bicyclic 3-hydroxyproprionate pathway for carbon fixation.
