CC  This HMM describes a tightly conserved subfamily of the larger family of sugar (and other) transporters described by PFAM HMM PF00083. Members of this subfamily include closely related forms SV2A and SV2B of synaptic vesicle protein from vertebrates and a more distantly related homolog (below trusted cutoff) from Drosophila melanogaster. Members are predicted to have two sets of six transmembrane helices.
