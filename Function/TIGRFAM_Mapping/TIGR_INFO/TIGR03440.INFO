CC  Members of this family include EgtB, and enzyme of the ergothioneine biosynthesis, as found in numerous Actinobacteria. Characterized homologs to this family include a formylglycine-generating enzyme that serves as a maturase for an aerobic sulfatase (cf. the radical SAM enzymes that serve as anaerobic sulfatase maturases).
