CC  This HMM represents NifA, a DNA-binding regulatory protein for nitrogen fixation. The model produces scores between the trusted and noise cutoffs for a well-described NifA homolog in Aquifex aeolicus (which lacks nitrogenase), for transcriptional activators of alternative nitrogenases (VFe or FeFe instead of MoFe), and truncated forms.
