CC  This HMM recognizes a number of type 2 lantibiotic-type bacteriocins, related to but distinct from the family that includes lichenicidin and mersacidin. Sequence similarity among members consists largely of a 20-residue block of conserved sequence that covers most of the leader peptide region, absent from the mature lantibiotic. This is followed by a region with characteristic composition for lantibiotic precursor regions, rich in Ser and Thr and including a near-invariant Cys near or at the C-terminus, involved in cyclization. Members of this family typically are shorter than 70 amino acids.
