CC  Members of this protein family are salicylate 1-monooxygenase, also called salicylate hydroxylase. This enzyme converts salicylate to catechol, which is a common intermediate in the degradation of a number of aromatic compounds (phenol, toluene, benzoate, etc.). The gene for this protein may occur in catechol degradation genes, such as those of the meta-cleavage pathway.
