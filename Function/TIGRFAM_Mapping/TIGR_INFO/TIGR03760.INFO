CC  Members of this protein family are the TraI putative relaxases required for transfer by a subclass of integrating conjugative elements (ICE) as found in Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf-5, and understood from study of two related ICE, SXT and R391. This model represents the N-terminal domain. Note that no homology is detected to the similarly named TraI relaxase of the F plasmid.
