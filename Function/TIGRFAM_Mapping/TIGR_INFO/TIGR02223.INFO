CC  FtsN is a poorly conserved protein active in cell division in a number of Proteobacteria. The N-terminal 30 residue region tends to by Lys/Arg-rich, and is followed by a membrane-spanning region. This is followed by an acidic low-complexity region of variable length and a well-conserved C-terminal domain of two tandem regions matched by Pfam model PF05036 (Sporulation related repeat), found in several cell division and sporulation proteins. The role of FtsN as a suppressor for other cell division mutations is poorly understood; it may involve cell wall hydrolysis.
