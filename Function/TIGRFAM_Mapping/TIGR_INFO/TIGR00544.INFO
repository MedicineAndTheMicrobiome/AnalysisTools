CC  The conversion of lipoprotein precursors into lipoproteins consists of three steps. First, the enzyme described by this model transfers a diacylglyceryl moiety from phosphatidylglycerol to the side chain of a Cys that will become the new N-terminus. Second, the signal peptide is removed by signal peptidase II. Finally, the free amino group of the new N-terminal Cys is acylated by apolipoprotein N-acyltransferase.
