CC  Members of this family are the ATP-binding protein of a conserved four gene ABC transporter operon found next to ectoine unilization operons and ectoine biosynthesis operons. Ectoine is a compatible solute that protects enzymes from high osmolarity. It is released by some species in response to hypoosmotic shock, and it is taken up by a number of bacteria as a compatible solute or for consumption. This family shows strong sequence similiarity to a number of amino acid ABC transporter ATP-binding proteins.
