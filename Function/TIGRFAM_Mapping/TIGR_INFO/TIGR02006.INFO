CC  This HMM represents IscS, one of several cysteine desulfurases from a larger protein family designated (misleadingly, in this case) class V aminotransferases. IscS is one of at least 6 enzymes characteristic of the IscSUA-hscAB-fsx system of iron-sulfur cluster assembly. Scoring almost as well as proteobacterial sequences included in the model are mitochondrial cysteine desulfurases, apparently from an analogous system in eukaryotes. The sulfur, taken from cysteine, may be used in other systems as well, such as tRNA base modification and biosynthesis of other cofactors.
