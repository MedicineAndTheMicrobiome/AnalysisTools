CC  The long precursor of the 86K protein originally described is proposed to have three domains. The N-terminal A-domain is acidic, repetitive, weakly conserved, readily removed by proteolysis during chloroplast isolation, and not required for protein translocation. The other domains are designated G (GTPase) and M (membrane anchor); this family includes most of the G domain and all of M.
