CC  This uncharacterized protein family was identified, by the method of partial phylogenetic profiling, as having a matching phylogenetic distribution to that of the photosynthetic reaction center of the alpha-proteobacterial type. It is nearly always encoded near other photosynthesis-related genes, including puhA.
