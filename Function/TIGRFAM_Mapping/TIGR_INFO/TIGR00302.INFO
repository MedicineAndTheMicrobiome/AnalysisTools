CC  In species such as Bacillus subtilis in which FGAM synthetase is split into two ORFs purL and purQ, this small protein, previously called yexA, is required for FGAM synthetase activity. Although the article does not make it clear whether this is a subunit or an accessory protein, it is encoded as part of the operon, which suggests stochiometric amounts, = subunit.
