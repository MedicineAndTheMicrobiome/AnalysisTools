CC  Members of this family are the PrdA proprotein. The polypeptide undergoes an autocatalytic cleavage that creates two subunits, one with a Cys-derived pyruvoyl motiety critical for activity. The D-proline reductase complex also contains a subunit derived from the prdB gene. The complex acts on D-proline, which may be supplied from L-proline by an active proline racemase encoded nearby.
