CC  Members of this family are associated with type VII secretion of WXG100 family targets in the Firmicutes, but not in the Actinobacteria. This highly divergent protein family consists largely of a central region of highly polar low-complexity sequence containing occasional LF motifs in weak repeats about 17 residues in length, flanked by hydrophobic N- and C-terminal regions.
