CC  Members of this protein family occur strictly in the presence of a peptide modification radical SAM enzyme described by model TIGR04115 and some small peptide in which, for a stretch, every fourth amino acid is Cys. Cysteine residues usually are flanked by residues with sterically small side chains, as with many radical SAM-modified peptides. Many of the latter are recognized by model TIGR04114.
