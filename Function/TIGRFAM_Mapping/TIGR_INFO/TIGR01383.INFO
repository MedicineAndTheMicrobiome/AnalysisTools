CC  This HMM represents the DJ-1 clade of the so-called ThiJ/PfpI family of proteins. PfpI, represented by a distinct model, is a putative intracellular cysteine protease. DJ-1 is described as an oncogene that acts cooperatively with H-Ras. Many members of the DJ-1 clade are annotated (apparently incorrectly) as ThiJ, a protein of thiamine biosynthesis. However, published reports of ThiJ activity and identification of a ThiJ/ThiD bifunctional protein describe an unrelated locus mapping near ThiM, rather than the DJ-1 homolog of E. coli. The ThiJ designation for this family may be spurious; the cited paper PMID:8885414 refers to a locus near thiD and thiM in E. coli, unlike the gene represented here. Current public annotation reflects ThiJ/ThiD bifunctional activity, apparently a property of ThiD and not of this locus.
