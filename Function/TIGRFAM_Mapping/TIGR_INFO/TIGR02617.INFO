CC  Members of this family belong to the beta-eliminating lyase family (PF01212) and act as tryptophanase (L-tryptophan indole-lyase). The tryptophanases of this family, as a rule, are found with a tryptophanase leader peptide (TnaC) encoded upstream. Both tryptophanases (4.1.99.1) and tyrosine phenol-lyases (EC 4.1.99.2) are found between trusted and noise cutoffs, but this model captures nearly all tryptophanases for which the leader peptide gene tnaC can be found upstream.
