CC  This HMM describes the 76-amino C-terminal domain of the halocin C8 precursor that actually becomes the mature bacteriocin halocin C8 after export and cleavage, as well as homologous C-terminal regions from many other archaea. Surprisingly, this Cys-rich region occurs also in many strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis. Gene regions do not provide evidence for post-translational modification other than cleavage. Halocin C8 is active against a broad range of archaea; the region N-terminal to the bacteriocin domain modeled here serves as the immunity protein for the cell secreting the bacteriocin.
