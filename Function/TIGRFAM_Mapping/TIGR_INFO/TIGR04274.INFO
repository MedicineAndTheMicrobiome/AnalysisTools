CC  Members of this protein family represent family 6 of the uracil-DNA glycosylase superfamily, where the five previously described families all act as uracil-DNA glycosylase (EC 3.2.2.27) per se. This family, instead, acts as a hypoxanthine-DNA glycosylase, where hypoxanthine results from deamination of adenine. Activity was shown directly for members from Methanosarcina barkeri and Methanosarcina acetivorans.
