CC  The family of known and putative glucose-1-phosphate thymidyltransferase (also called dTDP-glucose synthase) shows a deep split into a short form (see TIGR01207) and a long form described by this model. The homotetrameric short form is found in numerous bacterial species that incorporate dTDP-L-rhamnose, which it helps synthesize, into the cell wall. It is subject to feedback inhibition. This form, in contrast, is found in many species for which it serves as a sugar-activating enzyme for antibiotic biosynthesis and or other, unknown pathways, and in which dTDP-L-rhamnose is not necessarily produced.
