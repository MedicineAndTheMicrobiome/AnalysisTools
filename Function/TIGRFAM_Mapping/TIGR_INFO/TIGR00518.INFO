CC  The family of known L-alanine dehydrogenases (EC 1.4.1.1) includes representatives from the Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Cyanobacteria, and Actinobacteria, all with about 50 % identity or better. An outlier to this group in both sequence and gap pattern is the homolog from Helicobacter pylori, an epsilon division Proteobacteria, which must be considered a putative alanine dehydrogenase. In Mycobacterium smegmatis and M. tuberculosis, the enzyme doubles as a glycine dehydrogenase (1.4.1.10), running in the reverse direction (glyoxylate amination to glycine, with conversion of NADH to NAD+). Related proteins include saccharopine dehydrogenase and the N-terminal half of the NAD(P) transhydrogenase alpha subunit. All of these related proteins bind NAD and/or NADP.

RT  Glycine and alanine dehydrogenase activities are catalyzed by the same protein in Mycobacterium smegmatis: upregulation of both activities under microaerophilic adaptation.
