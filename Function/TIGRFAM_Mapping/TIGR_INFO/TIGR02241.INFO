CC  This family consists of uncharacterized proteins. All members so far represent bacterial genes found in apparent phage or otherwisely laterally transferred regions of the chromosome. Tentatively identified neighboring proteins tend to be phage tail region proteins. In some species, including Photorhabdus luminescens TTO1, several members of this family may be encoded near each other.
