CC  This subfamily of the penicillin binding proteins includes the  member from E. coli designated penicillin-binding protein 1C. Members have both transglycosylase and transpeptidase domains and are involved in forming cross-links in the late stages of peptidoglycan biosynthesis. All members of this subfamily are presumed to have the same basic function.
