CC  This model describes an uncharacterized bacterial protein family. Members average about 90 amino acids in length with several well-conserved uncommon amino acids (Trp, Met). The majority of species are marine bacteria. Few species have more than one copy, but Vibrio cholerae El Tor N16961 has three identical copies.
