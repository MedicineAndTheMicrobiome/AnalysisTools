CC  This model represents the beta subunit of the gamma-proteobacterial formate dehydrogenase.  This subunit contains four 4Fe-4S clusters and is involved in transmitting electrons from the alpha subunit (TIGR01553) at the periplasmic space to the gamma subunit which spans the cytoplasmic membrane [1].
CC  In addition to the gamma proteobacteria, a sequence from Aquifex aolicus falls within the scope of this model.  This appears to be the case for the alpha, gamma and epsilon (accessory protein TIGR01562) chains as well.
