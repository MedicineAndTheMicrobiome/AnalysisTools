CC  In twenty or so anoxygenic photosynthetic alpha-Proteobacteria known so far, a gene for a member of this protein family is present and is found in the vicinity of puhA, which encodes a component of the photosynthetic reaction center, and other genes associated with photosynthesis. This protein family is suggested, consequently, as a probable assembly factor for the photosynthetic reaction center, but its seems its actual function has not yet been demonstrated.
