CC  PhoB is a DNA-binding response regulator protein acting with PhoR in a 2-component system responding to phosphate ion.  PhoB acts as a positive regulator of gene expression for phosphate-related genes such as phoA, phoS, phoE and ugpAB as well as itself [1].  It is often found proximal to genes for the high-affinity phosphate ABC transporter (pstSCAB; GenProp0190) and presumably regulates these as well.
