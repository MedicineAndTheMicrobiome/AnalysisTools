CC  Several bacterial species have a paralog to homodimeric form of the pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 component (see model TIGR00759), often encoded next to L-methionine gamma-lyase gene (mdeA). The member from a strain of Pseudomonas putida was shown to act on alpha-ketobutyrate, which is produced by MdeA.This model serves as an exception model to TIGR00759, as other proteins hitting TIGR00759 should be identified as the pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 component.
