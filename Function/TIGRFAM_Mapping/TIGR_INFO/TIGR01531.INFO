CC  glycogen debranching enzyme possesses two different catalytic activities; oligo-1,4-->1,4-glucantransferase (EC 2.4.1.25) and amylo-1,6-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.33). Site directed mutagenesis studies in S. cerevisiae [1] indicate that the transferase and glucosidase activities are independent and located in different regions of the polypeptide chain. Proteins in this model belong to the larger alpha-amylase family. The model covers eukaryotic proteins with a seed composed of human, nematode and yeast sequences. Yeast seed sequence is well characterized. The model is quite rigorous; either query sequence yields large bit score or it fails to hit the model altogether. There doesn't appear to be any middle ground.
