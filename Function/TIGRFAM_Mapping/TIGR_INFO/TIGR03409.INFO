CC  Members of this protein family are ABC transporter permease proteins associated with urea transport and metabolism. This protein is found in a conserved five-gene transport operon typically found adjacent to urease genes. It was shown in Cyanobacteria that disruption leads to the loss of high-affinity urea transport activity.
