CC  This group of sequences represents a number of related clades with numerous examples of members adjacent to operons for the degradation of 2-aminoethylphosphonate (AEP) in Pseudomonas, Ralstonia, Bordetella and Burkholderia species.  These are transcriptional regulators of the LysR family which contain a helix-turn-helix (HTH) domain (PF00126) and a periplasmic substrate-binding protein-like domain (PF03466).
