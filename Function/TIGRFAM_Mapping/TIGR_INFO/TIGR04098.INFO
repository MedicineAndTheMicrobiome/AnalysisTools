CC  Radical SAM family TIGR04043 is a marker for a widespread eight-gene probable biosynthetic cluster of unknown function. This protein family describes a domain that occurs as an additional protein for some of those clusters, but also as the N-terminal domain of large, multidomain polyketide synthases and in other contexts.
