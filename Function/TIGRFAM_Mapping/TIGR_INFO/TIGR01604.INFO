TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  This model represents a domain of a paralogous family of Plasmodium yoelii genes preferentially located in the subtelomeric regions of the chromosomes [1].  There are no obvious homologs to these genes in any other organism.
CC  The genes found by this model often are associated with an N-terminal domain yoelii-specific domain such as PYST-C1 (TIGR01601).
