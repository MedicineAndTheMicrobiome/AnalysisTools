CC  The adenosylcobalamin-binding, catalytic chain of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase may form homodimers, as in mitochondrion and E. coli, or heterodimers with a shorter, homologous chain that does not bind adenosylcobalamin. This HMM describes this non-catalytic beta chain, as found in the enzyme from Propionibacterium freudenreichii, for which the 3-dimensional structure has been solved.
