EN  adenylate kinase, isozyme 1 subfamily
EC  2.7.4.3
TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  Members of this family are adenylate kinase, EC 2.7.4.3. This clade is found only in eukaryotes and includes human adenylate kinase isozyme 1 (myokinase). Within the adenylate kinase superfamily, this set appears specifically closely related to a subfamily of eukaryotic UMP-CMP kinases (TIGR01359), rather than to the large clade of bacterial, archaeal, and eukaryotic adenylate kinase family members in TIGR01351.
