CC  This model represents the putative phosphatase domain of a family of eukaryotic proteins including "Dullard" [1], and the NLI interacting factor (NIF)-like phosphatases [2].
CC  This domain is a member of the haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily by virtue of a conserved set of three catalytic motifs [3] and a conserved fold as predicted by PSIPRED.  The third motif in this family is distinctive (hhhhDNxPxxa) and aparrently lacking the last aspartate.  This domain is classified as a "Class III" HAD, since there is no large "cap" domain found between motifs 1 and 2 or motifs 2 and 3 [4].
CC  This domain is related to domains found in FCP1-like phosphatases (TIGR02250), and together both are detected by the Pfam model PF03031.
