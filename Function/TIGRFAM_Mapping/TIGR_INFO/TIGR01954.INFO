CC  NusA is a bacterial transcription termination factor. It is named for its interaction with phage lambda protein N, as part of the N utilization substance. Some members of the NusA family have a long C-terminal extension. This HMM represents an acidic 50-residue region found in two copies toward the C-terminus of most Proteobacterial NusA proteins, spaced about 26 residues apart. Analogous C-terminal extensions in some other bacterial lineages lack apparent homology but appear similarly acidic.
