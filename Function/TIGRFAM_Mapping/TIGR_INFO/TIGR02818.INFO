CC  The members of this protein family show dual function. First, they remove formaldehyde, a toxic metabolite, by acting as S-(hydroxymethyl)glutathione dehydrogenase (1.1.1.284). S-(hydroxymethyl)glutathione can form spontaneously from formaldehyde and glutathione, and so this enzyme previously was designated glutathione-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase. These same proteins are also designated alcohol dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.1) of class III, for activities that do not require glutathione; they tend to show poor activity for ethanol among their various substrate alcohols.
