CC  Members of this protein family appear to represent a novel form of phosphoribosylaminoimidazole-succinocarboxamide synthase (SAICAR synthetase), significantly different in sequence and gap pattern from a form (see TIGR00081) shared by a broad range of bacteria and eukaryotes. Members of this family are found within the gammaproteobacteria in the genera Vibrio, Shewanella, and Colwellia, and also (reported as a fragment) in the primitive eukarote Guillardia theta.
