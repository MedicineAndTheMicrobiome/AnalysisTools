CC  This pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enzyme degrades 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate, which in plants is a precursor of the ripening hormone ethylene, to ammonia and alpha-ketoglutarate. This model includes all members of this family for which function has been demonstrated experimentally, but excludes a closely related family often annotated as putative members of this family.
