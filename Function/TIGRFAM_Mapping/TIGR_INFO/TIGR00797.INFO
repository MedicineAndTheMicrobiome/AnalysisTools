CC  The Multi Antimicrobial Extrusion (MATE) Family (TC 2.A.66)
CC  The MATE family consists of probable efflux proteins including a functionally characterized multi drug efflux system from Vibrio parahaemolyticus, a putative ethionine resistance protein of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and the functionally uncharacterized DNA damage-inducible protein F (DinF) of E. coli. These proteins have 12 probable TMS.
