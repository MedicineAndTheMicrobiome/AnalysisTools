CC  Members of this family are phage proteins with ATP-dependent RNA ligase activity. Host defense to phage may include cleavage and inactivation of specific tRNA molecules; members of this family act to reverse this RNA damage. The enzyme is adenylated, transiently, on a Lys residue in a motif KXDGSL.
