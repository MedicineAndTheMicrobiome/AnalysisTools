TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  Members of this family are radical SAM/SPASM domain proteins from a cassette restricted to the genus Geobacter. Genes always found adjacent include a non-radical SAM protein with a closely related SPASM domain and a short stretch of N-terminal homology as well to this family, and also a PqqD-like protein. The three-gene cassette is designated GeoRSP for the genus Geobacter, this radical SAM protein, the SPASM domain protein, and the PqqD family protein.
