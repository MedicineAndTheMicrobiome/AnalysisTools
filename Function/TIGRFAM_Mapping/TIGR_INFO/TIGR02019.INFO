CC  This HMM represents the component of bacteriochlorophyll synthetase responsible for reduction of the B-ring pendant ethylene (4-vinyl) group.  It appears that this step must precede the reduction of ring D, at least by the "dark" protochlorophyllide reductase enzymes BchN, BchB and BchL [1].  This family appears to be present in photosynthetic bacteria except for the cyanobacterial clade.  Cyanobacteria must use a non-orthologous gene to carry out this required step for the biosynthesis of both bacteriochlorophyll and chlorophyll.
