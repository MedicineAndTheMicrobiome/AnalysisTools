CC  Members of this protein family are restricted to bacterial species with the PEP-CTERM/exosortase system predicted to act in exopolysaccharide-associated protein targeting. PSI-BLAST and CDD reveal relationships to the acyltransferase family that includes N-acyl-L-homoserine lactone synthetase, and recent work shows long-chain N-acyl amino acid biosynthesis activity. Several members of this family may be found in a single genome. These acyltransferases may produce a quorum signalling molecule or may contribute to chemical modifications in exopolysaccharide and biofilm structural material production.
