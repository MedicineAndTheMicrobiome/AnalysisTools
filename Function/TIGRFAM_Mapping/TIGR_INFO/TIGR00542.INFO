CC  This family shows similarity by PSI-BLAST to other isomerases. Putative identification as hexulose-6-phosphate isomerase is reported in Swiss-Prot, attributing a discussion in Genome Sci. Technol. 1:53-75(1996).
CC  This family is conserved at better than 40 % identity among the four known examples from three species: Escherichia coli (SgbU and SgaU), Haemophilus influenzae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. The rarity of the family, high level of conservation, and proposed catabolic role suggests lateral transfer may be a part of the evolutionary history of this protein.
