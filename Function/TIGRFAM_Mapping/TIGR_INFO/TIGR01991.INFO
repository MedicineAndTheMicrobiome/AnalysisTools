CC  The Heat Shock Cognate proteins HscA and HscB act together as chaperones. HscA resembles DnaK but belongs in a separate clade. The apparent function is to aid assembly of iron-sulfur cluster proteins. Homologs from Buchnera and Wolbachia are clearly in the same clade but are highly derived and score lower than some examples of DnaK.
