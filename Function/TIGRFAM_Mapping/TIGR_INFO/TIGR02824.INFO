CC  Members of this family are putative quinone oxidoreductases that belong to the broader superfamily (modeled by Pfam PF00107) of zinc-dependent alcohol (of medium chain length) dehydrogenases and quinone oxiooreductases. The alignment shows no motif of conserved Cys residues as are found in zinc-binding members of the superfamily, and members are likely to be quinone oxidoreductases instead. A member of this family in Homo sapiens, PIG3, is induced by p53 but is otherwise uncharacterized.
