CC  This HMM represents the I subunit (one of 14: A->N) of the NADH-quinone oxidoreductase complex I which generally couples NADH and ubiquinone oxidation/reduction in bacteria and mammalian mitochondria, but may act on NADPH and/or plastoquinone in cyanobacteria and plant chloroplasts.  This HMM excludes "I" subunits from the closely related F420H2 dehydrogenase and formate hydrogenlyase complexes.
