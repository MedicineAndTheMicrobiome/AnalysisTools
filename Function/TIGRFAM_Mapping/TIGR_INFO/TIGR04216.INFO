CC  Members of this family are the S-layer-forming halobacterial major cell surface glycoprotein. The highest scores below model cutoffs are fragmentary paralogs to actual members of the family. Modifications include at N-linked and O-linked glycosylation, a C-terminal diphytanylglyceryl modification, and probable cleavage of the PGF-CTERM tail.
