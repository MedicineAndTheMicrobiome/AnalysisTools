CC  This family consists of examples of the form of dihydroxyacetone kinase (also called glycerone kinase) that uses ATP (2.7.1.29) as the phosphate donor, rather than a phosphoprotein as in E. coli. This form is composed of a single chain with separable domains homologous to the K and L subunits of the E. coli enzyme, and is found in yeasts and other eukaryotes and in some bacteria, including Citrobacter freundii. The member from tomato has been shown to phosphorylate dihydroxyacetone, 3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone, and some other aldoses and ketoses (PMID:11985845).
