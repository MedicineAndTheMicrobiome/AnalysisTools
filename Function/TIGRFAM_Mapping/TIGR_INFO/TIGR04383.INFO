CC  Members of this family are acidic surface proteins with an N-terminal signal peptide and a variant C-terminal sortase recognition sequence, LPXTA rather than LPXTG. The N-terminal region past the signal peptide is repeated a second or third time in many members of this family. Members occur in Firmicutes, encoded next to a dedicated sortase related to SrtC that assembles pilins, suggesting that this protein serves a structural rather than enzymatic role. Processing by the neighboring sortase may result in polymerization as well as surface attachment.
