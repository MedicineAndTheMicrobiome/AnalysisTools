CC  Type II members of the DMSO reductase family are heterotrimeric proteins with bis(molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide)Mo, iron-sulfur, and heme b prosthetic groups bound by the alpha, beta, and gamma subunits respectively. Members of this protein family are not part of the mature protein, although they are the product of a fourth clustered gene. Proteins in this family are interpreted as a chaperone, analogous to NarJ of nitrate reductases.
