CC  Two different classes of sorting signal, both analogous to the sortase A signal LPXTG, may be recognized by the sortase SrtB. These are given as NXZTN and NPKXZ. Proteins sorted by this class of sortase are less common than the sortase A and LPXTG system. This model describes a number of cell surface protein C-terminal regions from Gram-positive bacteria that appear to be sortase B (SrtB) sorting signals.
