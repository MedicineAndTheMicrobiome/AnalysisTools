CC  Members of this family are found among cas (CRISPR-Associated) genes close to CRISPR repeats in Leptospira interrogans (a spirochete), Myxococcus xanthus (a delta-proteobacterium), and Lyngbya sp. PCC 8106 (a cyanobacterium). It is found with other cas genes in Anabaena variabilis ATCC 29413. In Lyngbya sp., the protein is split into two tandem genes. This model corresponds to the C-terminal region or downstream gene; the N-terminal region is modeled by  TIGR03485. CRISPR/cas systems are associated with prokaryotic acquired resistance to phage and other exogenous DNA.
