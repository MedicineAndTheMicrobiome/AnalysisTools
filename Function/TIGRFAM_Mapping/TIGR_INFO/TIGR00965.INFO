CC  This enzyme is part of the diaminopimelate pathway of lysine biosynthesis.
CC  Alternate name: tetrahydrodipicolinate N-succinyltransferase.
CC  The closely related TabB protein of Pseudomonas syringae (pv. tabaci), SP|P31852|TABB_PSESZ, appears to act in the biosynthesis of tabtoxin rather than lysine.  The trusted cutoff is set high enough to exclude this gene.  Sequences below trusted also include a version of this enzyme which apparently utilize acetate rather than succinate (EC: 2.3.1.89).
