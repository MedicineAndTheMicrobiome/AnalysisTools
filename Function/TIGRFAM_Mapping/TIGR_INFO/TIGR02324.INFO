CC  Members of this family are the PhnL protein of C-P lyase systems for utilization of phosphonates. These systems resemble phosphonatase-based systems in having a three component ABC transporter, where TIGR01097 is the permease, TIGR01098 is the phosphonates binding protein, and TIGR02315 is the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) protein. They differ, however, in having, typically, ten or more additional genes, many of which are believed to form a membrane-associated C-P lysase complex.  This protein (PhnL) and the adjacent-encoded PhnK (TIGR02323) resemble transporter ATP-binding proteins but are suggested, based on mutatgenesis studies, to be part of this C-P lyase complex rather than part of a transporter per se.
