CC  This model represents essentially the full length, ~60 residues, of a two-gene paralogous family from Acidobacterium sp. MP5ACTX8. Sequences consist of an N-terminal signal sequence ending in a GC motif, suggestive of the lipoprotein signal sequence, followed immediately by a C-terminal domain sequence with characteristics PEP-CTERM-like sequences, including a PExP motif and a transmembrane helix. Both members occur next to the novel exosortase variant, XrtJ, which contains a novel C-terminal domain.
