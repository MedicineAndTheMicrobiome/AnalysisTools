CC  Members of this family show C-terminal sequence similarity, perhaps indicating distant homology, to cytochrome c-prime (see Pfam family PF01322). However, the motif CxxCH is replaced by xxxCH. Genes for this protein occur in a sporadically distributed genome context, largely in deltaProteobacteria, in which an ATP-grasp family glutamate ligase homolog and a CofD (LPPG:FO 2-phospho-L-lactate transferase) homolog suggest a novel biosynthesis.
