CC  This protein family is related to the predicted protein-sorting transpeptidase Exosortase (EpsH), with the Cys, Arg, and His putative active site residues preserved, but it is strictly archaeal and is not associated with any known PEP-CTERM-like target sequence. The immediate gene neighborhood in most genomes suggests RNA (methylase, cyclase) and cofactor (thiamine pyrophosphate) metabolism. The function is unknown. It is designated archaeosortase family protein ArtE.
