CC  This model represents 3-phosphoshikimate-1-carboxyvinyltransferase (aroA), which catalyzes the sixth of seven steps in the shikimate pathway of the biosynthesis of chorimate. Chorismate is last common precursor of all three aromatic amino acids.
CC  Sequences scoring between the trusted and noise cutoffs include fragmentary and aberrant sequences in which generally well-conserved motifs are missing or altererd, but no example of a protein known to have a different function.
