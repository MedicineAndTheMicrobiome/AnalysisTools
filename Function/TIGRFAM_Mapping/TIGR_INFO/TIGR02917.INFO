CC  This protein family occurs in strictly within a subset of Gram-negative bacterial species with the proposed PEP-CTERM/exosortase system, analogous to the LPXTG/sortase system common in Gram-positive bacteria. This protein occurs in a species if and only if a transmembrane histidine kinase (TIGR02916) and a DNA-binding response regulator (TIGR02915) also occur. The present of tetratricopeptide repeats (TPR) suggests protein-protein interaction, possibly for the regulation of PEP-CTERM protein expression, since many PEP-CTERM proteins in these genomes are preceded by a proposed DNA binding site for the response regulator.
