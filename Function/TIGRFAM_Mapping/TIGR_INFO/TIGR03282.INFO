CC  Members of this protein family, to date, are found in a completed prokaryotic genome if and only if the species is one of the archaeal methanogens. The exact function is unknown, but likely is linked to methanogenesis or a process closely connected to it. This metal cluster-binding family is related to nitrogenase structural protein NifD and accessory protein NifE, among others.
