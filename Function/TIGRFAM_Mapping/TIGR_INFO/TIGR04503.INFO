CC  Members of this small protein family are putative electron transfer flavoproteins, related to FixA from E. coli and EtfB from Methylophilus methylotrophus but clearly forming a distinctive clade. All members occur in species with a mycofactocin system. We have proposed that mycofactocin is a redox carrier synthesized from a ribosomally translated peptide with aid from a radical SAM enzyme, analogous to PQQ.
