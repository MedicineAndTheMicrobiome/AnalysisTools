CC  DXP synthase is a thiamine diphosphate-dependent enzyme related to transketolase and the pyruvate dehydrogenase E1-beta subunit. By an acyloin condensation of pyruvate with glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, it produces 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate, a precursor of thiamine diphosphate (TPP), pyridoxal phosphate, and the isoprenoid building block isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP).
