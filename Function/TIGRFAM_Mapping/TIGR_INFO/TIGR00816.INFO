CC  The Tellurite-Resistance/Dicarboxylate Transporter (TDT) Family (TC 2.A.16)
CC  Two members of the TDT family have been functionally characterized. One is the TehA protein of E. coli which has been implicated in resistance to tellurite; the other is the Mae1 protein of S. pombe which functions in the uptake of malate and other dicarboxylates by a proton symport
CC  mechanism. These proteins  exhibit 10 putative transmembrane a-helical
CC  spanners (TMSs).
