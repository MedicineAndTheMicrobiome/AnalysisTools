CC  Members of this protein family are predicted to be oxidoreductases dependent on coenzyme F420. The family includes a single member in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Rv3520c/MT3621) but four in Mycobacterium smegmatis. Prediction that this family is F420-dependent is based primarily on Partial Phylogenetic Profiling vs. F420 biosynthesis.
