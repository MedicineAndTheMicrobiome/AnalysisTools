CC  Members of this protein family are primosomal replication protein N (PriB), virtually always encoded between rpsF (ribosomal protein S6) and rpsR (ribosomal protein S18). Note that only this short form, as found primarily in the gamma-Proteobacteria, of the single-stranded DNA binding protein family (see model TIGR00621) may partner with PriA and be involved in priming for re-initiation of replication.
