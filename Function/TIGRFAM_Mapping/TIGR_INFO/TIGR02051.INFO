CC  This HMM represents the mercury (II) responsive transcriptional activator of the mer organomercurial resistance operon [1].  This protein is a member of the MerR family of transcriptional activators (PF00376) and contains a distinctive pattern of cysteine residues in its metal binding loop, Cys-X(8)-Cys-Pro, as well as a conserved and critical cysteine at the N-terminal end of the dimerization helix [2].
