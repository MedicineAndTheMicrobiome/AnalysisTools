CC  This HMM represents the whole of the small chain of the glutamine-dependent form (EC 6.3.5.5) of carbamoyl phosphate synthase, CPSase II. The C-terminal domain has glutamine amidotransferase activity. Note that the sequence from the mammalian urea cycle form has lost the active site Cys, resulting in an ammonia-dependent form, CPSase I (EC 6.3.4.16). CPSases of pyrimidine biosynthesis, arginine biosynthesis, and the urea cycle may be encoded by one or by several genes, depending on the species.
DR  EXCEPTION; SP|P31327; EC 6.3.4.16 (no GATase activity)
