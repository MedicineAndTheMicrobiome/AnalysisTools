CC  This family consists of members of the HAD superfamily, subfamily IIB. All members are closely related to mannosyl-3-phosphoglycerate phosphatase, the second enzyme in a two-step pathway for biosynthesis of mannosylglycerate, a compatible solute present in some thermophiles and in Dehalococcoides ethenogenes. However, members of this family are separable in a neighbor-joining tree constructed from a multiple sequence alignment and are found only in mesophiles that lack the companion mannosyl-3-phosphoglycerate synthase (TIGR02460). Members of this family are like to act on a compound related to yet distinct from mannosyl-3-phosphoglycerate.
