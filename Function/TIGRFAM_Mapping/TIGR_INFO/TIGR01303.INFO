EN  IMP dehydrogenase family protein
TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  This HMM represents a family of proteins, often annotated as a putative IMP dehydrogenase, related to IMP dehydrogenase and GMP reductase and restricted to the high GC Gram-positive bacteria. All species in which a member is found so far (Corynebacterium glutamicum, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Streptomyces coelicolor, etc.) also have IMP dehydrogenase as described by TIGRFAMs entry TIGR01302.
