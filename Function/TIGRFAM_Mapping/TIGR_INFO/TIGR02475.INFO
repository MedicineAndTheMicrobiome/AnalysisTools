CC  The family of proteins identified by this model is generally found proximal to the trimeric cobaltochelatase subunit CobN which is essential for vitamin B12 (cobalamin) biosynthesis [1].
CC  The protein contains an P-loop nucleotide-binding loop in the N-terminal domain and a histidine-rich region in the C-terminal portion suggesting a role in metal binding, possibly as an intermediary between the cobalt transport and chelation systems.
CC  A broader CobW family is delineated by two PFAM models which identify the N- and C-terminal domains (PF02492 and PF07683).
