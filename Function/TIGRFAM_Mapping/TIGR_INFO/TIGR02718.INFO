CC  RhtX from Sinorhizobium meliloti 2011 and FptX from Pseudomonas aeruginosa appear to be single polypeptide transporters, from the major facilitator family (see PF07690) for import of siderophores as a means to import iron. This function was suggested by proximity to siderophore biosynthesis genes and then confirmed by study of knockout and heterologous expression phenotypes.
