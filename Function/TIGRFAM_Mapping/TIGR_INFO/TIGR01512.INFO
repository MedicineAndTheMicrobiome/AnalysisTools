CC  This model describes the P-type ATPase primarily responsible for translocating cadmium ions (and other closely-related divalent heavy metals such as cobalt, mercury, lead and zinc) across biological membranes.  These transporters are found in prokaryotes and plants. 
CC  Experimentally characterized members of the seed alignment include: SP|P37617 from E. coli, SP|Q10866 from Mycobacterium tuberculosis and SP|Q59998 from Synechocystis PCC6803.
CC  The cadmium P-type ATPases have been characterized as Type IB based on a phylogenetic analysis which combines the copper-translocating ATPases with the cadmium-translocating species [1].  This HMM and that describing the copper-ATPases (TIGR01511) are well separated, and thus we further type the copper-ATPases as IB1 and the cadmium-ATPases as IB2.
CC  Several sequences which have not been characterized experimentally fall just below trusted cutoff for both of these models (SP|Q9CCL1 from Mycobacterium leprae, GP|13816263 from Sulfolobus solfataricus, OMNI|NTL01CJ01098 from Campylobacter jejuni, OMNI|NTL01HS01687 from Halobacterium sp., GP|6899169 from Ureaplasma urealyticum and OMNI|HP1503 from Helicobacter pylori).
