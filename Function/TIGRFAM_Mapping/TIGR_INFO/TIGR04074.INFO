CC  Members of this protein family are bacterial Hen1, a 3' terminal RNA ribose 2'-O-methyltransferase that acts in bacterial RNA repair. All members of the seed alignment belong to a cassette with the RNA repair enzyme polynucleotide kinase-phosphatase (Pnkp). Chemically similar Hen1 in eukaryotes acts instead on small regulatory RNAs.
