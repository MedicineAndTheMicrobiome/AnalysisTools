EN  putative cross-wall-targeting lipoprotein signal
TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  The YSIRK signal domain targets proteins to the cross-wall, or septum, of dividing Gram-positive bacterial. Lipoprotein signal motifs direct a characteristic N-terminal cleavage and lipid modification for membrane anchoring. This Streptococcal-only signal peptide variant appears to be a hybrid between the two, likely directing protein targeting of nascent surface lipoproteins to the cross-wall. Nearly all members of this family have the characteristic LPXTG cell wall anchor signal at the C-terminus.
