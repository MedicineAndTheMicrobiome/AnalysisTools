CC  Members of this family are glutamate 2,3-aminomutase, a radical SAM enzyme with a pyridoxal phosphate group. It is closely related to lysine 2,3-aminomutase, but distinguished by architecture (longer N-terminal region, shorter C-terminal region) and replacement of key lysine-binding residues  Asp293 and Asp330 (inferred from the crystal structure) by glutamate-binding residues Lys and Asn. Activity was demonstrated for sequences from Clostridium difficile, Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis MB4, and Syntrophomonas wolfei str. Goettingen. The action of this enzyme creates beta-glutamate, an osmolyte.
