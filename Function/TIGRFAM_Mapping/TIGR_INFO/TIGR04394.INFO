CC  Members of this family, homologs to pyruvate formate-lyases and benzylsuccinate synthases, are glycine radical enzymes that appear to act as choline TMA-lyase, that is, to perform a C-N bond cleavage turning choline into trimethylamine (TMA) plus acetaldehyde. The gene symbol is cutC, for choline utilization. The activase, CutD, is a radical SAM enzyme.
