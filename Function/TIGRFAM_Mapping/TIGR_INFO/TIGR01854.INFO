CC  This HMM represents LpxH, UDP-2,3-diacylglucosamine hydrolase, and essential enzyme in E. coli that catalyzes the fourth step in lipid A biosynthesis. Note that Pseudomonas aeruginosa has both a member of this family that shares this function and a more distant homolog, designated LpxH2, that does not. Many species that produce lipid A lack an lpxH gene in this family; some of those species have an lpxH2 gene instead, although for which the function is unknown.
