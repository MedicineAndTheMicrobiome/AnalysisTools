CC  The Ca2+:Cation Antiporter (CaCA) Family (TC 2.A.19)
CC  Proteins of the CaCA family are found ubiquitously, having been identified in animals, plants, yeast, archaea and widely divergent bacteria.
CC  All of the characterized animal proteins catalyze Ca2+:Na+ exchange although some also transport K+. The NCX1 plasma membrane protein exchanges 3 Na+ for 1 Ca2+. The E. coli ChaA protein catalyzes Ca2+:H+ antiport but may also catalyze Na+:H+ antiport. All remaining well-characterized members of the family catalyze Ca2+:H+ exchange.
CC  This Hmm is specific for the eukaryotic sodium ion/calcium ion exchangers of the Caca family
