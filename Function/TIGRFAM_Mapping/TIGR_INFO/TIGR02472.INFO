CC  This family consists of the N-terminal regions, or in some cases the entirety, of bacterial proteins closely related to plant sucrose-phosphate synthases (SPS). The C-terminal domain (TIGR02471), found with most members of this family, resembles both bona fide plant sucrose-phosphate phosphatases (SPP) and the SPP-like domain of plant SPS. At least two members of this family lack the SPP-like domain, which may have binding or regulatory rather than enzymatic activity by analogy to plant SPS. This enzyme produces sucrose 6-phosphate and UDP from UDP-glucose and D-fructose 6-phosphate, and may be encoded near the gene for fructokinase.
