CC  This protein family consists of luciferase-like monooxygenases (LLM), and include KPN_01858 from Klebsiella pneumoniae as a representative member. Most are from species that lack F420 biosynthesis, so the family is likely to bind FMN as its cofactor. This family is closely associated with a binding protein-dependent ABC transporter, suggesting a role in catabolism.
