CC  This protein family is restricted to a subset of endospore-forming bacteria such as Bacillus subtilis, all of which are in the Firmicutes (low-GC Gram-positive) lineage. It is a minor SASP (small, acid-soluble spore protein) designated SspI. The gene in Bacillus subtilis previously was designated ysfA.
