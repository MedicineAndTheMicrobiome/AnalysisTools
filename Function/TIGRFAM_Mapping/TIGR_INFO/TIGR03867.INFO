CC  This HMM describes the Ralstonia lineage variant of the GlyGly-CTERM domain (TIGR03501), a predicted target for protein sorting and cleavage by rhombosortase, a member of the family of rhomboid proteases.  Note that some MprA family proteases are full-length homologs except for the lack of this domain. All members of the present family are predicted serine proteases.
