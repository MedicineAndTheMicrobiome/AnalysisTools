CC  This subset of the radical-SAM family (PF04055) includes a number of probable activating proteins acting on different enzymes all requiring an amino-acid-centered radical.  The closest relatives to this family are the pyruvate-formate lyase activating enzyme (PflA, 1.97.1.4, TIGR02493) and the anaerobic ribonucleotide reductase activating enzyme (TIGR02491).  Included within this subfamily are activators of hydroxyphenyl acetate decarboxylase (HdpA, [1]), benzylsuccinate synthase (BssD, [2]), gycerol dehydratase (DhaB2, [3]) as well as enzymes annotated in E. coli as activators of different isozymes of pyruvate-formate lyase (PFLC and PFLE) however, these appear to lack characterization and may activate enzymes with distinctive functions.  Most of the sequence-level variability between these forms is concentrated within an N-terminal domain which follows a conserved group of three cysteines and contains a variable pattern of 0 to 8 additional cysteines.
