CC  Characterized members of this family are B12-binding domain/radical SAM domain enzymes that use methylcobalamin as a methyl donor to methylate a phosphorous atom during the biosynthesis of natural products such as bialaphos and phosalacine. These syntheses create an extremely rare C-P-C bond. All members of the seed alignment derive from genomic regions that include a non-ribosomal peptide synthase. Note that a single organism, Pelosinus fermentans JBW45 from Cr(VI)-contaminated groundwater, has eight additional homologs of unknown function that score between trusted and noise cutoffs of this model.
