CC  Members of this protein family are found in temperate phage and bacterial prophage regions. Members include the product of the rha gene of the lambdoid phage phi-80, a late operon gene. The presence of this gene interferes with infection of bacterial strains that lack integration host factor (IHF), which regulates the rha gene. It is suggested that pRha is a phage regulatory protein.
