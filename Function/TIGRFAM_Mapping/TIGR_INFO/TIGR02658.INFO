CC  This family consists of the heavy chain of methylamine dehydrogenase light chain, a periplasmic enzyme.  The enzyme contains a tryptophan tryptophylquinone (TTQ) prothetic group  derived from two Trp residues in the light subunity. The enzyme forms a complex with the type I blue copper protein amicyanin and a cytochrome. Electron transfer procedes from TQQ to the copper and then to the heme group of the cytochrome.
