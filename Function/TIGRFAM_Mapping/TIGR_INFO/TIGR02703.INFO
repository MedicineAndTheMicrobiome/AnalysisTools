CC  This model distinguishes one of two closely related paralogs encoded by nearby genes in the carboxysome operons of a number of cyanobacteria and chemoautotrophic bacteria. More distantly related proteins, also belonging to Pfam family PF03319, participate in other types of shell such as the ethanolamine degradation organelle.
