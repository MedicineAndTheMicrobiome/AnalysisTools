CC  The short N-terminal domain contains four conserved Cys for binding of a ferric iron atom, and is homologous to the small protein desulforedoxin; this domain may also be responsible for dimerization. The remainder of the molecule binds a ferrous iron atom and is similar to neelaredoxin, a monomeric blue non-heme iron protein.
CC  The homolog from Treponema pallidum scores between the trusted cutoff for orthology and the noise cutoff. Although essentially a full length homolog, it lacks three of the four Cys residues in the N-terminal domain; the domain may have lost ferric binding ability but may have some conserved structural role such as dimerization, or some new function.
CC  This protein is described in some articles as rubredoxin oxidoreductase (rbo), and its gene shares an operon with the rubredoxin gene in Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough.
