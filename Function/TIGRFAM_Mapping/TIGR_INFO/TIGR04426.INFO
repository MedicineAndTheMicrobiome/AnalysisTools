CC  Members of this protein family, including DesII, are radical SAM enzymes that deaminate TDP-4-amino-4,6-dideoxy-D-glucose to TDP-3-keto-4,6-dideoxy-D-glucose. This is the fourth step of the six step  pathway in Streptomyces venezuelae for synthesizing D-desosamine, or 3-(dimethylamino)-3,4,6-trideoxyglucose, a precursor for many macrolide antibiotics.
