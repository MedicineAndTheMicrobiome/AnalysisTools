CC  Members of this protein family are the FliI protein of bacterial flagellum systems. This protein acts to drive protein export for flagellar biosynthesis. The most closely related family is the YscN family of bacterial type III secretion systems.  This model represents one (of three) segment of the FliI family tree.  These have been modeled separately in order to exclude the type III secretion ATPases more effectively.
