CC  Members of this protein family are ribonuclease BN of Escherichia coli K-12 and closely related proteins believed to be equivalent in function. Note that E. coli appears to lack RNase Z per se, and this protein of E. coli appears orthologous to (but not functionally equivalent to) RNase Z of Bacillus subtilis and various other species. Meanwhile, the yihY gene product of E. coli previously was incorrectly identified as RNase BN.
