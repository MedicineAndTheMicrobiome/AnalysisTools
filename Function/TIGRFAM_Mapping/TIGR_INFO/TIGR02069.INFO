CC  This HMM describes both cytosolic and extracellular cyanophycinases. The former are part of a system in many Cyanobacteria and a few other species of generating and later utilizing a storage polymer for nitrogen, carbon, and energy, called cyanophycin. The latter are found in species such as Pseudomonas anguilliseptica that can use external cyanophycin. The polymer has a backbone of L-aspartic acid, with most Asp side chain carboxyl groups attached to L-arginine.
