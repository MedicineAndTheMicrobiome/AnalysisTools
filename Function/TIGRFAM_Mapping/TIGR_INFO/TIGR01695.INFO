CC  This HMM represents MurJ (previously MviN), a family of integral membrane proteins predicted to have ten or more transmembrane regions. Members have been suggested to act as a lipid II flippase, translocated a precursor of murein. However, it appears FtsW has that activity. Flippase activity for MurJ has not been shown.
