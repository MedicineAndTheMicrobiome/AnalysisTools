CC  This HMM describes LpxD, an enzyme for the biosynthesis of lipid A, a component oflipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the outer membrane outer leaflet of most Gram-negative bacteria. Some differences are found between lipid A of different species. This protein represents the third step from UDP-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine. The group added at this step generally is 14:0(3-OH) (myristate) but may vary; in Aquifex it appears to be 16:0(3-OH) (palmitate).
