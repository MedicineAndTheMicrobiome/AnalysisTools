CC  Members of this family are the enzyme 4-hydroxybenzoate 3-monooxygenase, also called p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase. It converts 4-hydroxybenzoate + NADPH + molecular oxygen to protocatechuate + NADPH + water. It contains monooxygenase (PF01360) and FAD binding (PF01494) domains.  Pathways that contain this enzyme include the protocatechuate 4,5-degradation pathway.
