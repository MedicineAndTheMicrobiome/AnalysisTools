CC  In general, members of this protein family are designated pyrimidine-nucleoside phosphorylase, enzyme family EC 2.4.2.2, as in Bacillus subtilis, and more narrowly as the enzyme family EC 2.4.2.4, thymidine phosphorylase (alternate name: pyrimidine phosphorylase), as in Escherichia coli. The set of proteins encompassed by this model is designated subfamily rather than equivalog for this reason; the protein name from this model should be used when TIGR02643 does not score above trusted cutoff.
