CC  This model describes a form of threonine ammonia-lyase, a pyridoxal-phosphate dependent enzyme, with two copies of the threonine dehydratase C-terminal domain (Pfam:PF00585). Members with known function participate in isoleucine biosynthesis and are inhibited by isoleucine.
CC  Alternate name: threonine deaminase, threonine dehydratase.
CC  Forms scoring between the trusted and noise cutoff tend to branch with this subgroup of threonine ammonia-lyase phylogenetically but have only a single copy of the C-terminal domain.
