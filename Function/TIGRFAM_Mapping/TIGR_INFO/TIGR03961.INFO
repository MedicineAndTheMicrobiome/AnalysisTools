TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  Members of this protein family average about 340 residues in length, with a radical SAM domain in the N-terminal 200 residues. The taxonomic distribution is restricted to non-methanogenic archaea, including Picrophilus torridus (locus PTO1314), Sulfolobus sp., Thermoplasma sp., Picrophilus torridus, and Metallosphaera sedula. The gene neighborhood is not conserved, and the function of this family is unknown.
