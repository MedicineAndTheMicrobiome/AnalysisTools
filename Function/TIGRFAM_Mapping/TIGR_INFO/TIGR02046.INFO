CC  This family consists of the succinate dehydrogenase subunit C of Bacillus subtilis, designated cytochrome b-558, and related sequences that include a fumarate reductase subunit C. This subfamily is only weakly similar to the main group of succinate dehydrogenase cytochrome b subunits described by Pfam model PF01127, so that some members score above the gathering threshold and some do not.
