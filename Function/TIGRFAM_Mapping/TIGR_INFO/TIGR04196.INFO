CC  Members of this family, including sublancin, are post-ribosomal natural products (PRNP) with an S-linked glycosylation. Sublancin itself also has two disulfide bonds. A related gene cluster in Bacillus cereus E33L includes the four Cys involved in the disulfide cluster but lacks the region with the glycosylated Cys. These score ~ 27 by this HMMER3 model and are excluded.
