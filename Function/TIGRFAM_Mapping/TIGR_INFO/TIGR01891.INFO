CC  This model represents a subfamily of amidohydrolases which are a subset of those sequences detected by PF01546.  Included within this group are hydrolases of hippurate (N-benzylglycine), indoleacetic acid (IAA) N-conjugates of amino acids, N-acetyl-L-amino acids and aminobenzoylglutamate.  These hydrolases are of the carboxypeptidase-type, most likely utilizing a zinc ion in the active site.
