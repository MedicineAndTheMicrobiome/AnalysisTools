CC  Members of this family occur only in the genus Leptospira, always encoded between genes for the YajC and SecD components of the Sec preprotein translocase. Sequences have an N-terminal signal peptide and a C-terminal transmembrane segment. Between these are regions of non-globular, low-complexity sequence including Lys-rich and Ser/Thr/Asn/Glu-rich regions.
