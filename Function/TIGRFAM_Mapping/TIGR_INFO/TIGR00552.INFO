CC  NAD+ synthetase is a nearly ubiquitous enzyme for the final step in the biosynthesis of the essensial cofactor NAD. The member of this family from Bacillus subtilis is a strictly NH(3)-dependent NAD(+) synthetase of 272 amino acids. Proteins consisting only of the domain modeled here may be named as NH3-dependent NAD+ synthetase. Amidotransferase activity may reside in a separate protein, or not be present. Some other members of the family, such as from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, are considerably longer, contain an apparent amidotransferase domain, and show glutamine-dependent as well as NH(3)-dependent activity.
