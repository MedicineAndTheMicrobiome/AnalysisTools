CC  These proteins are members of the Cadmium Resistance (CadD) Family (TC 2.A.77).  To date, this family of proteins has only been found in Gram-positive bacteria.  The CadD family includes several closely related Staphylococcal proteins reported to function in cadmium resistance. Members are predicted to span the membrane five times; the mechanism of resistance is believed to be export but has also been suggested to be binding and sequestration in the membrane. Closely related but outside the scope of this model is another staphylococcal protein that has been reported to possibly function in quaternary ammonium ion export. Still more distant are other members of the broader LysE family (see Vrljic. et al, PMID:10943564).
