CC  This family represents the stage III sporulation protein AF of the bacterial endospore formation program, which exists in some but not all members of the Firmicutes (formerly called low-GC Gram-positives). The C-terminal region of this protein is poorly conserved, so only the N-terminal region, which includes two predicted transmembrane domains, is included in the seed alignment.
