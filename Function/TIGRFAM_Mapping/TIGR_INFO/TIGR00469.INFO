CC  Unlike all other known phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetases, the mitochondrial form demonstrated from yeast is monomeric. It is similar to but longer than the alpha subunit (PheS) of the alpha 2 beta 2 form found in Bacteria, Archaea, and eukaryotes, and shares the characteristic motifs of class II aminoacyl-tRNA ligases. This HMM models the experimental example from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (designated MSF1) and its orthologs from other eukaryotic species.
