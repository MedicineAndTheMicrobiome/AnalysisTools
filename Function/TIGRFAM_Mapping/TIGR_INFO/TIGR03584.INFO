CC  The sequences in this family include the PF02348 (cytidyltransferase) domain and are homologous to the NeuA protein responsible for the transfer of CMP to neuraminic acid.  According to [1], this gene is responsible for the transfer of CMP to the structurally related sugar, pseudaminic acid which is observed as a component of sugar modifications of flagellin in Campylobacter species.  This gene is commonly observed in apparent operons with other genes responsible for the biosynthesis of pseudaminic acid and as a component of flagellar and exopolysaccharide biosynthesis loci.
