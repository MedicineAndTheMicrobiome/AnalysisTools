CC  This model represents the dehydrogenase responsible for the conversion of 5-carboxymethyl-2-hydroxymuconate semialdehyde to 5-carboxymethyl-2-hydroxymuconate (a tricarboxylic acid).  This is the step in the degradation of 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid via homoprotocatechuate following the oxidative opening of the aromatic ring.
