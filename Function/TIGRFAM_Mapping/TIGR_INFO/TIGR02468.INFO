CC  Members of this family are sucrose-phosphate synthases of plants. This enzyme is known to exist in multigene families in several species of both monocots and dicots. The N-terminal domain is the glucosyltransferase domain. Members of this family also have a variable linker region and a C-terminal domain that resembles sucrose phosphate phosphatase (SPP) (EC 3.1.3.24) (see TIGR01485), the next and final enzyme of sucrose biosynthesis. The SPP-like domain likely serves a binding and not a catalytic function, as the reported SPP is always encoded by a distinct protein.
