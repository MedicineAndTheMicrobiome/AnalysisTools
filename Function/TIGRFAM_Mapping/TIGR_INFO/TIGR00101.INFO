CC  This HMM represents UreG, a GTP hydrolase that acts in the assembly of the nickel metallocenter of urease. It is found only in urease-positive species, although some urease-positive species (e.g. Bacillus subtilis) lack this protein. A similar protein, hypB, is an accessory protein for expression of hydrogenase, which also uses nickel.
