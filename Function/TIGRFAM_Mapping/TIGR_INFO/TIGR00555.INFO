CC  This model describes a eukaryotic form of pantothenate kinase, characterized from the fungus Aspergillus nidulans and with similar forms known in several other eukaryotes. It also includes forms from several Gram-positive bacteria suggested to have originated from the eukaryotic form by lateral transfer. It differs in a number of biochemical properties (such as inhibition by acetyl-CoA) from most bacterial CoaA and lacks sequence similarity. This enzyme is the key regulatory step in the biosynthesis of coenzyme A (CoA).
