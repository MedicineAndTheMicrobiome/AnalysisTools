CC  Endonuclease that resolves Holliday junction intermediates in genetic recombination. The active form of the protein is a dimer. Structure studies reveals that the catalytic center, comprised of four acidic residues, lies at the bottom of a cleft that fits a DNA duplex. The model hits a single Synechocystis PCC6803 protein at a score of 30, below the trusted cutoff, that appears orthologous and may act as authentic RuvC.
