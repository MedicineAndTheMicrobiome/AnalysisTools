CC  Members of this family are short polypeptides with a conserved GG motif as found in bacteriocins that are cleaved upon export. Each gene occurs immediately upstream of a gene for a peptide-modifying radical SAM/SPASM domain protein. The system is designated Xye for genera Xenorhabdus, Yersinia, and Erwinia, hence XyeA for the precursor peptide. The vicinity will also contain a transport protein with a C39 family peptidase domain (see PF03412), characteristic of GG motif cleave-on-export systems. The function of this RiPP family is unknown.
