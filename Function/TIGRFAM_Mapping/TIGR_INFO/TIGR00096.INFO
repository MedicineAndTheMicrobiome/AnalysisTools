CC  This protein, previously known as YraL, is RsmI, one of a pair of genes involved in a unique dimethyl modification of a cytidine in 16S rRNA. See Pfam model PF00590 (tetrapyrrole methylase), which demonstrates homology between this family and other members,  including several methylases for the tetrapyrrole class of compound, as well as the enzyme diphthine synthase.
