CC  The family consists of the product of the rpoC2 gene, a subunit of DNA-directed RNA polymerase of cyanobacteria and chloroplasts. RpoC2 corresponds largely to the C-terminal region of the RpoC (the beta' subunit) of other bacteria. Members of this family are designated beta'' in chloroplasts/plastids, and beta' (confusingly) in Cyanobacteria, where RpoC1 is called beta' in chloroplasts/plastids and gamma in Cyanobacteria. We prefer to name this family beta'', after its organellar members, to emphasize that this RpoC1 and RpoC2 together replace RpoC in other bacteria.
