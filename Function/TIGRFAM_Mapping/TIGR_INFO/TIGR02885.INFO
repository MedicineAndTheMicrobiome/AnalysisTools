CC  Members of this protein family are the RNA polymerase sigma factor F. Sigma-F is specifically and universally a component of the Firmicutes lineage endospore formation program, and is expressed in the forespore to turn on expression of dozens of genes. It is closely homologous to sigma-G, which is also expressed in the forespore.
