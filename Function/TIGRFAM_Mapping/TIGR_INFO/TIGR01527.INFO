CC  This HMM describes a family of archaeal proteins with the activity of the NAD salvage biosynthesis enzyme nicotinamide-nucleotide adenylyltransferase (EC 2.7.7.1). In some cases, the enzyme was tested and found also to have the activity of nicotinate-nucleotide adenylyltransferase (EC 2.7.7.18), an enzyme of NAD de novo biosynthesis, although with a higher Km.
CC  In some archaeal species, a lower-scoring paralog, uncharacterized with respect to activity, is also present. These score between trusted and noise cutoffs.
