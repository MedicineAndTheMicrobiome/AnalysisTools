CC  This HMM describes peptide chain release factor 1 (PrfA, RF-1), and excludes the related peptide chain release factor 2 (PrfB, RF-2). RF-1 helps recognize and terminate translation at UAA and UAG stop codons. The mitochondrial release factors are prfA-like, although not included above the trusted cutoff for this model. RF-1 does not have a translational frameshift.
