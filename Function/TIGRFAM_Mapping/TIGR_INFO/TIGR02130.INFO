CC  This narrow family includes genes from Arabidopsis and Fibrobacter succinogenes (which probably recieved the gene from a plant via lateral gene transfer).  The sequences are distantly related to the dihydrodipicolinate reductases from archaea.  In Fibrobacter this gene is the only candidate DHPR in the genome.
