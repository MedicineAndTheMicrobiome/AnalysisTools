CC  Members of this protein family, designated variously as YftE, NorA, DrnN, and NipC, are di-iron proteins involved in the repair of iron-sulfur clusters. Previously assigned names reflect pleiotropic effects of damage from NO or other oxidative stress when this protein is mutated. The suggested name now is RIC, for Repair of Iron Centers.
