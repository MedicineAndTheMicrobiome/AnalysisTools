CC  Members of this protein family are precursors of TOMMs, that is, thizazole/oxazole-modified microcins. Members are about 42 residues in length, have a C-terminal region of extremely low complexity rich in Ser, and are often missed by ab initio gene callers. The plantazolicin from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens FZB42 is a peptide antibiotic effective against Bacillus anthracis.
