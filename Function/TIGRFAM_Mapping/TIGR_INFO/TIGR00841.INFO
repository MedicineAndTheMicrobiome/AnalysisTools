CC  The Bile Acid:Na+ Symporter (BASS) Family (TC 2.A.28)
CC  Functionally characterized members of the BASS family catalyze Na+:bile acid symport. These systems have been identified in intestinal, liver and kidney tissues of animals. These symporters exhibit broad specificity, taking up a variety of non bile organic compounds as well as taurocholate and other bile salts. Functionally uncharacterised homologues are found in plants, yeast, archaea and bacteria.
