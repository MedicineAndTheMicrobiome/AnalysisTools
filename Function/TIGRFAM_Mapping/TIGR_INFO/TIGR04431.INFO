CC  Members of this family are the aacA4 type of aminoglycoside N(6')-acetyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.82), an enzyme that modifies and inactivates aminoglycoside antibiotics such as kanamycin, neomycin, tobramycin, and amikacin. Members are regularly spread among pathogens into integron, transposon, and plasmid loci, with recombination often happening within the protein-coding region. Most of the region amino-terminal to the recombination site or sites was removed from this model.
