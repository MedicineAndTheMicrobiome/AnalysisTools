CC  Orotate phosphoribosyltransferase (OPRTase) is involved in the biosynthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides. Alpha-D-ribosyldiphosphate 5-phosphate (PRPP) and orotate are utilized to form pyrophosphate and orotidine 5'-monophosphate (OMP) in the presence of divalent cations, preferably Mg2+.
CC  In a number of eukaryotes, this protein is fused to a domain that catalyses the reaction (EC 4.1.1.23). The combined activity of EC 2.4.2.10 and EC 4.1.1.23 is termed uridine 5'-monophosphate synthase.
CC  The conserved Lys (K) residue at position 101 of the seed alignment has been proposed as the active site for the enzyme.
