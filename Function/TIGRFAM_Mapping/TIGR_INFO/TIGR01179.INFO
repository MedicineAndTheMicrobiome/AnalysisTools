CC  Alternate name: UDPgalactose 4-epimerase
CC  This enzyme interconverts UDP-glucose and UDP-galactose. A set of related proteins, some of which are tentatively identified as UDP-glucose-4-epimerase in Thermotoga maritima, Bacillus halodurans, and several archaea, but deeply branched from this set and lacking experimental evidence, are excluded from this HMM and described by a separate model.
