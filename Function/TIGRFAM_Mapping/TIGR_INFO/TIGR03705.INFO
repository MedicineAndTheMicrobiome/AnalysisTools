CC  Members of this protein family are the enzyme polyphosphate kinase 1 (PPK1). This family is found in many prokaryotes and also in Dictyostelium. Sequences in the seed alignment were taken from prokaryotic consecutive two-gene pairs in which the other gene encodes an exopolyphosphatase. It synthesizes polyphosphate from the terminal phosphate of ATP but not GTP, in contrast to PPK2.
