CC  This model represents the diaminopimelate dehydrogenase enzyme which provides an alternate (shortcut) route of lysine buiosynthesis in Corynebacterium, Bacterioides, Porphyromonas and scattered other species.  The enzyme from Corynebacterium glutamicum has been crystallized and characterized [1].
