CC  The member of this family in E. coli is UbiD, 3-octaprenyl-4-hydroxybenzoate carboxy-lyase. The family described by this HMM, however, is broad enough that it is likely to contain several different decarboxylases. 
CC  Found in bacteria, archaea, and yeast, with two members in A. fulgidus. No homologs were detected besides those classified as orthologs. The member from H. pylori has a C-terminal extension of just over 100 residues that is shared in part by the Aquifex aeolicus homolog.
