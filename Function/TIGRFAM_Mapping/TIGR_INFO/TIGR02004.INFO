CC  This model represents a family of PTS enzyme II fused B and C components including and most closely related to the MalX maltose and glucose-specific transporter of E. coli [1].  A pair of paralogous genes from E. coli strain CFT073 score between trusted and noise and may have diverged sufficiently to have an altered substrate specificity.

RT  The malX malY operon of Escherichia coli encodes a novel enzyme II of the phosphotransferase system recognizing glucose and maltose and an enzyme abolishing the endogenous induction of the maltose system.
