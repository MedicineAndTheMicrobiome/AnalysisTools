CC  A Genome Properties metabolic reconstruction for F420 biosynthesis shows that slightly over 10 percent of all prokaryotes with fully sequenced genomes, including about two thirds of the Actinomycetales, make F420. A variant of the Partial Phylogenetic Profiling algorithm, SIMBAL, shows that this protein likely binds F420 in a cleft similar to that in which the homologous enzyme pyridoxamine phosphate oxidase (PPOX) binds FMN.
