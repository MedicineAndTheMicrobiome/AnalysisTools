CC  This gene for this monooxygenase is found within apparent operons for the degradation of 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid in Deinococcus, Thermus and Oceanobacillus.  Phylogenetic trees support inclusion of the Bacillus halodurans sequence above trusted although the complete 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid degradation pathway may not exist in that organism.  Generally, this enzyme acts with the assistance of a small flavin reductase domain protein (HpaC) to provide the cycle the flavin reductant for the reaction.  This family of sequences is a member of a larger subfamily of monooxygenases (PF03241).
