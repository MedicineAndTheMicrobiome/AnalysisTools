CC  Two types of dihydroxyacetone kinase (glycerone kinase) are described. In yeast and a few bacteria, e.g. Citrobacter freundii, the enzyme is a single chain that uses ATP as phosphoryl donor and is designated EC 2.7.1.29. By contract, E. coli and many other bacterial species have a multisubunit form (EC 2.7.1.-) with a phosphoprotein donor related to PTS transport proteins. This family represents the subunit homologous to the E. coli YcgS subunit.
