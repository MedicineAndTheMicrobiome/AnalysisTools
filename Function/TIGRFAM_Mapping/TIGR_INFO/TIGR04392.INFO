EN  hydroxylamine oxidation protein HaoB
GS  haoB
TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  Members of this family occur as the HaoB (hydroxylamine oxidation B) protein encoded next to the homotrimeric HaoA, hydroxylamine oxidoreductase, a protein with eight heme groups. It appears all species with this enzyme are nitrifying bacteria.
