CC  Members of this protein family include LptA (previously called YhbN). It was shown to be an essential protein in E. coli, implicated in cell envelope integrity, and to play a role in the delivery of LPS to the outer leaflet of the outer membrane. It works with LptB (formerly yhbG), a homolog of ABC transporter ATP-binding proteins, encoded by an adjacent gene. Numerous homologs in other Proteobacteria are found in a conserved location near lipopolysaccharide inner core biosynthesis genes. This family is related to organic solvent tolerance protein (OstA), though distantly.
