CC  Members of this family usually are small proteins (PatC, TenC, TruC) of unknown function in cyanobactin (prenylated cyclic peptide) biosynthesis clusters, where a different small protein is a known cyanobactin precursor (patellamide, anacyclamide, piricyclamide, etc). They may instead be the C-terminal domain of a longer protein that otherwise consists mostly of lectin-like or VWF type A domains, in similar context. Similar to the cyanobactin precursors, members of this family have two very strongly conserved regions separated by a hypervariable region, suggesting these proteins may undergo a similar maturation.
