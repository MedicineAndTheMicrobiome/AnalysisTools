EN  IMP dehydrogenase family protein
TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  This HMM represents a family of proteins, often annotated as a putative IMP dehydrogenase, related to IMP dehydrogenase and GMP reductase. Most species with a member of this family belong to the high GC Gram-positive bacteria, and these also have the IMP dehydrogenase described by TIGRFAMs equivalog model TIGR01302.
