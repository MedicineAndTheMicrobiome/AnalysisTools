CC  This HMM represents a family of proteins containing an unusual 4Fe-2S-2O hydrid cluster. Earlier reports had proposed a 6Fe-6S prismane cluster. This subfamily is heterogeneous with respect to the presence or absence of a region of about 100 amino acids not far from the N-terminus of the protein. Members have been described as monomeric. The general function is unknown, although members from E. coli and several other species have hydroxylamine reductase activity. Members are found in various bacteria, in Archaea, and in several parasitic eukaryotes: Giardia intestinalis, Trichomonas vaginalis, and Entamoeba histolytica.
