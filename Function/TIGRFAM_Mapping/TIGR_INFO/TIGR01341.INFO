CC  This HMM represents one form of the TCA cycle enzyme aconitate hydratase, also known as aconitase and citrate hydro-lyase. It is found in bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotic cytosol. It has been shown to act also as an iron-responsive element binding protein in animals and may have the same role in other eukaryotes.
