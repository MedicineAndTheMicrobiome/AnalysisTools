CC  This model describes the ELAV/HuD subfamily of splicing factors found in metazoa.  HuD stands for the human paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis antigen D of which there are 4 variants in human [1].  ELAV stnds for the Drosophila Embryonic lethal abnormal visual protein [2].  ELAV-like splicing factors are also known in human as HuB (ELAV-like protein 2), HuC (ELAV-like protein 3, Paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration-associated antigen) and HuR (ELAV-like protein 1).  These genes are most closely related to the sex-lethal subfamily of splicing factors found in Dipteran insects (TIGR01659).
CC  These proteins contain 3 RNA-recognition motifs (rrm: PF00076).
