CC  Members of this family include NosD, a repetitive periplasmic protein required for the maturation of the copper-containing enzyme nitrous-oxide reductase. NosD appears to be part of a complex with NosF (an ABC transporter family ATP-binding protein) and NosY (a six-helix transmembrane protein in the ABC-2 permease family). However, NosDFY-like complexes appear to occur also in species whose copper requiring enzymes are something other than nitrous-oxide reductase.
