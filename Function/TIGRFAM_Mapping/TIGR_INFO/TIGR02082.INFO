CC  This family represents 5-methyltetrahydrofolate--homocysteine methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.13), one of at least three different enzymes able to convert homocysteine to methionine by transferring a methyl group on to the sulfur atom. It is also called the vitamin B12(or cobalamine)-dependent methionine synthase. Other methionine synthases include 5-methyltetrahydropteroyltriglutamate--homocysteine
CC  S-methyltransferase (MetE, EC 2.1.1.14, the cobalamin-independent methionine synthase) and betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase.
