CC  This HMM represents a small family of proteins with a typical Tat (twin-arginine translocation) signal sequence, suggesting that the family is exported in a folded state, perhaps with a bound redox cofactor. Members of this family show homology to Dyp, a dye-decolorizing peroxidase from Geotrichum candidum that lacks any typical heme-binding site.
