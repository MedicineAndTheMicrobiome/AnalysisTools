CC  This subfamily HMM groups together three clades: the characterized beta-phosphoglucomutases (including those from E.coli, B.subtilus and L.lactis, TIGR01990), a clade of putative bPGM's from mycobacteria and a clade including the uncharacterized E.coli and H.influenzae yqaB genes which may prove to be beta-mutases of a related 1-phosphosugar.
CC  All of these are members of the larger Haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) subfamily IA and include the "variant 3" glu-asp version of the third conserved HAD domain (TIGR01509).
