TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  This subfamily falls within the Haloacid Dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily of aspartate-nucleophile hydrolases.  The Class III subfamilies are characterized by the lack of any domains located between either between the first and second conserved catalytic motifs (as in the Class I subfamilies, TIGR01493, TIGR01509, TIGR01488 and TIGR01494) or between the second and third conserved catalytic motifs (as in the Class II subfamilies, TIGR01460 and TIGR01484) of the superfamily domain.  The IIIA subfamily contains five major clades: histidinol-phosphatase (TIGR01261, [3]) and histidinol-phosphatase-related protein (TIGR00213) which together form a subfamily (TIGR01656), DNA 3'-phosphatase (TIGR01663, TIGR01664), YqeG (TIGR01668) and YrbI (TIGR01670).  
CC  In the case of histidinol phosphatase and PNK-3'-phosphatase, this model represents a domain of a bifunctional system.  In the histidinol phosphatase HisB, a C-terminal domain is an imidazoleglycerol-phosphate dehydratase which catalyzes a related step in histidine biosynthesis.  In PNK-3'-phosphatase, N- and C-terminal domains constitute the polynucleotide kinase and DNA-binding components of the enzyme.
