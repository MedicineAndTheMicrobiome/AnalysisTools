CC  The sequences of ATP synthase F1 alpha and beta subunits are related and both contain a nucleotide-binding site for ATP and ADP. They have a common amino terminal domain but vary at the C-terminus. The beta chain has catalytic activity, while the alpha chain is a regulatory subunit. The alpha-subunit contains a highly conserved adenine-specific noncatalytic nucleotide-binding domain. The conserved amino acid sequence is Gly-X-X-X-X-Gly-Lys. Proton translocating ATP synthase F1, alpha subunit is homologous to proton translocating ATP synthase archaeal/vacuolar(V1), B subunit.
