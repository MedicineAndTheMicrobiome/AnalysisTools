CC  A single member of this protein family is found in each of the first ten complete genome sequences of archaeal methanogens, and nowhere else. This protein family was detected by the method of partial phylogenetic profiling (see Haft, et al., 2006). The functions of proteins in this family are unknown, but their role is likely one essential to methanogenesis.
