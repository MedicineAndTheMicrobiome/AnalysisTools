CC  Sequences in this family occur as the N-terminal domain of a fusion protein with a C-terminal peroxidase-like protein, or as discrete protein encoded next to a peroxidase-like protein. The two partners regularly are encoded near to, and in the same genomes as, a putative FMN-dependent luciferase-like monooxygenase (LLM) (TIGR04027), and an ABC transporter in which TIGR04028 models the substrate-binding protein. CDD identifies this family as falling within the CMD superfamily that includes carboxymuconolactone decarboxylase.
