CC  Members of this family are found in Nostoc sp. PCC 7120, Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Sinorhizobium meliloti, and Gloeobacter violaceus in a conserved two-gene neighborhood. This family, as defined, includes some members of COG4711 but is narrower and strictly bacterial. Members appear to span the membrane seven times.
