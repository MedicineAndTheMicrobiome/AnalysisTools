CC  Members of this protein family are 6-hydroxycyclohex-1-ene-1-carbonyl-CoA dehydrogenase, an enzyme in the anaerobic metabolism of aromatic enzymes by way of benzoyl-CoA, as seen in Thauera aromatica, Geobacter metallireducens, and Azoarcus sp. The experimentally characterized form from T. aromatica uses only NAD+, not NADP+. Note that Rhodopseudomonas palustris uses a different pathway to perform a similar degradation of benzoyl-CoA to 3-hydroxpimelyl-CoA.
