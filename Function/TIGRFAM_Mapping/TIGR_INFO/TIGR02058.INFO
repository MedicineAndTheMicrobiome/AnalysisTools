CC  This family consists of few members, broadly distributed. It occurs so far in several Firmicutes (twice in Oceanobacillus), one Cyanobacterium, one alpha Proteobacterium, and (with a long prefix) in plants. The function is unknown. The alignment includes a perfectly conserved motif GxGxDxHG near the N-terminus.
