CC  This model represents GlpX, one of three classes of bacterial fructose-1,6-bisphosphatases. This form is homodimeric and Mn2+-dependent, and only very distantly related to the class I fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, the product of the fbp gene, which is homotetrameric and Mg2+-dependent. A third class is found as one of two types in Bacillus subtilis.
CC  In E. coli, GlpX is found in the glpFKX operon together with a glycerol update protein and glycerol kinase.
