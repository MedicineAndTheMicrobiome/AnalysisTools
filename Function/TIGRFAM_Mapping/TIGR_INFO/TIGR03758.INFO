CC  Members of this family of small, hydrophobic proteins are found occasionally on plasmids such as the Pseudomonas putida TOL (toluene catabolic) plasmid pWWO_p085. Usually, however, they are found on the bacterial main chromosome in regions flanked by markers of conjugative transfer and/or transposition.
