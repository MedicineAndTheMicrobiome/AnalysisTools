CC  This model describes the enzyme o-succinylbenzoic acid synthetase (menC) that is involved in one of the steps of the menaquinone biosynthesis pathway.  It takes SHCHC and makes it into 2-succinylbenzoate.  Included in this model are gamma proteobacteria and archaea.  Many of the com-names of the proteins identified by the model are identified as O-succinylbenzoyl-CoA synthase in error.
