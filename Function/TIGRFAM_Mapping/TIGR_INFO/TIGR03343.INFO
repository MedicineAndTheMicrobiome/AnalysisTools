CC  Members of this family are 2-hydroxy-6-oxo-6-phenylhexa-2,4-dienoate hydrolase, or HOPD hydrolase, the BphD protein of biphenyl degradation. BphD acts on the product of ring meta-cleavage by BphC. Many species carrying bphC and bphD are capable of degrading polychlorinated biphenyls as well as biphenyl itself.

RT  The bphDEF meta-cleavage pathway genes involved in biphenyl/polychlorinated biphenyl degradation are located on a linear plasmid and separated from the initial bphACB genes in Rhodococcus sp. strain RHA1.
