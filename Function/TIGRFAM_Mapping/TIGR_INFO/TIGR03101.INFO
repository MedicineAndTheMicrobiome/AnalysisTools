CC  This group of proteins are members of the alpha/beta hydrolase superfamily.  These proteins are generally found in genomes containing the exosortase/PEP-CTERM protein expoert system [1], specifically the type 1 variant of this system described by the Genome Property GenProp0652.  When found in this context they are invariably present in the vicinity of a second, relatively unrelated enzyme (ortholog 1, TIGR03100) of the same superfamily.
