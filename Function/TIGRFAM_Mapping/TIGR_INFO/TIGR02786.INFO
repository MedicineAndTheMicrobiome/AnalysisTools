CC  AddAB is a system well described in the Firmicutes as a replacement for RecBCD in many prokaryotes for the repair of double stranded break DNA damage. More recently, a distantly related gene pair conserved in many alphaproteobacteria was shown also to function in double-stranded break repair in Rhizobium etli. This family consists of AddB proteins of the alphaproteobacteial type.
