CC  This family contains pyridoxal phosphate-binding class II aminotransferases (see PFAM:PF00222) closely related to, yet distinct from, histidinol-phosphate aminotransferase (HisC). It is found in cobalamin biosynthesis operons in Salmonella typhimurium and Bacillus halodurans (each of which also has HisC) and has been shown to have L-threonine-O-3-phosphate decarboxylase activity in Salmonella. Although the gene symbol cobD was assigned in Salmonella, cobD in other contexts refers to a different cobalamin biosynthesis enzyme, modeled by PF03186 and called cbiB in Salmonella.

RT  CobD, a novel enzyme with L-threonine-O-3-phosphate decarboxylase activity, is responsible for the synthesis of (R)-1-amino-2-propanol O-2-phosphate, a proposed new intermediate in cobalamin biosynthesis in Salmonella typhimurium LT2.
