CC  This subunit of the FadJI complex has acetyl-CoA C-acyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.16) activity, and is also known as beta-ketothiolase and fatty oxidation complex, beta subunit, and YfcY. This protein is almost always located adjacent to FadJ (TIGR02440).  The FadJI complex is needed for anaerobic beta-oxidation of short-chain fatty acids in E. coli.
