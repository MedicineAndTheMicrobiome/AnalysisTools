CC  This model discriminates eubacterial (and mitochondrial) translation initiation factor 2 (IF-2), encoded by the infB gene in bacteria, from similar proteins in the Archaea and Eukaryotes. In the bacteria and in organelles, the initiator tRNA is charged with N-formyl-Met instead of Met. This translation factor acts in delivering the initator tRNA to the ribosome. It is one of a number of GTP-binding translation factors recognized by the pfam HMM GTP_EFTU.
