CC  Members of this protein family occur, so far, exclusively in the genus Leptospira. Members, although small (about 90 amino acids), have a predicted signal peptide followed by a region with eight invariant Cys residues. Some members have an additional Cys in the signal peptide region that suggests handling as a lipoprotein, but this Cys is not well conserved.
