CC  This HMM describes a sporadically distributed conserved hypothetical protein in which complete members average over 500 amino acids in length, although matching sequences frequently are truncated or broken into tandem ORFs. Regular co-clustering with known markers of mobility (integrases, transposases, phage proteins, restriction enzymes, etc.) suggests this family also is part of the mobilome. The function is unknown.
