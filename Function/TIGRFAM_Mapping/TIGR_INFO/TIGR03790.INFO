CC  Despite a broad and sporadic distribution (Cyanobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, Acidobacteria, beta and delta Proteobacteria, and Planctomycetes), this uncharacterized protein family occurs only among the roughly 8 percent of prokarotyic species that carry homologs of the integral membrane protein exosortase (see TIGR02602), a proposed protein-sorting system transpeptidase.
