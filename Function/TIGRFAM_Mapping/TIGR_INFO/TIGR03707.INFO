CC  Members of this protein family are designated polyphosphate kinase 2 (PPK2) after the characterized protein in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This family comprises one of three well-separated clades in the larger family described by Pfam model PF03976.  PA0141 from this family has been shown capable of operating in reverse, with GDP preferred (over ADP) as a substrate, producing GTP (or ATP) by transfer of a phosphate residue from polyphosphate. Most species with a member of this family also encode a polyphosphate kinase 1 (PPK1).
