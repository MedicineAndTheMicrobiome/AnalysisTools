CC  Muramic delta-lactam is an unusual constituent of peptidoglycan, found only in bacterial spores in the peptidoglycan wall, or spore cortex. The proteins in this family are PdaA (yfjS), a member of a larger family of polysaccharide deacetylases, and are specificially involved in delta-lactam biosynthesis. PdaA acts immediately after CwlD, an N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase and performs a de-N-acetylation. PdaA may also perform the following transpeptidation for lactam ring formation, as heterologous expression in E. coli of CwlD and PdaA together is sufficient for delta-lactam production.
