CC  The seed members for this model are a paralogous family of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Nearly all proteins scoring above the noise cutoff are from high-GC Gram-positive organisms. The members of this paralogous family of efflux proteins are all found in operons with ATP-binding chain partners. They are related to a putative daunorubicin resistance efflux protein of Streptomyces peucetius.
CC  This model represents a branch of a larger superfamily that also includes NodJ, a part of the NodIJ pair of nodulation-triggering signal efflux proteins. The members of this branch may all act in antibiotic resistance.
