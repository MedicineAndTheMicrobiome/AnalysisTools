CC  Phosphatidylserine decarboxylase is synthesized as a single chain precursor. Generation of the pyruvoyl active site from a Ser is coupled to cleavage of a Gly-Ser bond between the larger (beta) and smaller (alpha chains). It is an integral membrane protein. A closely related family, possibly also active as phosphatidylserine decarboxylase, falls under model TIGR00164.
