CC  Psp29, originally designated sll1414 in Synechocystis 6803, is found universally in Cyanobacteria and in Arabidopsis. It was isolated and partially sequenced from purified photosystem II (PS II) in Synechocystis. While its function is unknown, mutant studies show an impairment in photosystem II biogenesis and/or stability, rather than in PS II core function.
