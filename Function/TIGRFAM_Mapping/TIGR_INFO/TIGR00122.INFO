CC  This model represents the amino-terminal helix-turn-helix repressor region of the biotin--acetyl-CoA-carboxylase ligase/biotin operon repressor bifunctional protein BirA. In many species, the biotin--acetyl-CoA-carboxylase ligase ortholog lacks this DNA-binding repressor region and therefore is not equivalent to the well-characterized BirA of E. coli.
CC  This HMM may recognize some other putative repressor proteins, such as DnrO of Streptomyces peucetius with scores below the noise cutoff but with significance shown by low E-value.
