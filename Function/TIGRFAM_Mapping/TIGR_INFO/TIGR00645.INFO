CC  This conserved hypothetical protein with four predicted transmembrane regions is found in E. coli, Haemophilus influenzae, and Helicobacter pylori, among completed genomes. A similar protein from Aquifex aeolicus appears to share a central region of homology and a similar overall arrangement of hydrophobic stretches, and forms a bidirectional best hit with several members of the seed alignment. However, it is uncertain whether the observed similarity represents full-length homology and/or equivalent function, and so it is excluded from the seed and scores below the trusted cutoff.
