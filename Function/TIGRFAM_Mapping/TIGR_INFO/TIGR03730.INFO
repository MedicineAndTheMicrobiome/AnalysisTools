EN  tungstate ABC transporter binding protein WtpA
TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  Members of this protein family are tungstate (and, more weakly, molybdate) binding proteins of tungstate(/molybdate) ABC transporters, as first characterized in Pyrococcus furiosus. Model seed members and cutoffs, pending experimental evidence for more distant homologs, were chosen such that this model identifies select archaeal proteins, excluding weaker archaeal and all bacterial homologs. Note that this family is homologous to molybdate transporters, and that at least one other family of tungstate transporter binding protein, TupA, also exists.
