CC  Members of this protein family are the single chain precursor of the S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase as found in Escherichia coli. This form shows a substantially different architecture from the form shared by the Archaea, Bacillus, and many other species (TIGR03330). It shows little or no similarity to the form found in eukaryotes (TIGR00535).
