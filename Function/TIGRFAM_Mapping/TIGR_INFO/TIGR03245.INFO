CC  In some bacteria, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the astB gene (arginine N-succinyltransferase) is replaced by tandem paralogs that form a heterodimer. This heterodimer from P. aeruginosa is characterized as arginine and ornithine N-2 succinyltransferase (AOST). Members of this protein family represent the less widespread paralog, designated AruI, or arginine/ornithine succinyltransferase, alpha subunit.
