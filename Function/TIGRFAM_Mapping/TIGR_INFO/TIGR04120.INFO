CC  This HMM describes a family of ATP-dependent DNA ligases present in about 12 % of prokaryotic genomes. It occurs as part of a four-gene system with an exonuclease, a helicase and a phosphoesterase, with all four genes clustered or at least the first two and last two paired. This family resembles DNA ligase I (see TIGR00574 and PF01068), and its presumed function may be in DNA repair, replication, or recombination.
