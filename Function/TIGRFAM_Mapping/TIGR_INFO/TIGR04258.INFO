CC  This domain occurs as a suffix domain to some members of the much broader protein family TIGR02436, a few of whose other members are encoded within intervening sequences of bacterial 23S ribosomal RNA. Some proteins with this domain, in turn, are followed by a predicted DNA topoisomerase type C4 zinc finger.
