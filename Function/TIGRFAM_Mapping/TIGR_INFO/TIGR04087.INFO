CC  Members of this protein, including the partially characterized YqxM of Bacillus subtilis, are always found adjacent to a variant form, SipW, of signal peptidase, and are targets for this signal peptide, as is the biofilm protein constituent TasA. The function may always be associated with biofilm formation. In one instance, this protein is fused with the SipW signal peptidase.
