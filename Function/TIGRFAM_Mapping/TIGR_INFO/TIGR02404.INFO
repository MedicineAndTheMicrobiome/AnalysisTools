CC  This family consists of repressors of the GntR family typically associated with trehalose utilization operons. Trehalose is imported as trehalose-6-phosphate and then hydrolyzed by alpha,alpha-phosphotrehalase to glucose and glucose-6-P. This family includes repressors mostly from Gram-positive lineages and does not include the TreR from E. coli.
