CC  This HMM represents a single-molecule form of phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine synthase, also called FGAM synthase, an enzyme of purine de novo biosynthesis.  This model represents a second clade of these enzymes found in Clostridia, Bifidobacteria and Streptococcus species.  This enzyme performs the fourth step in IMP biosynthesis (the precursor of all purines) from PRPP.
