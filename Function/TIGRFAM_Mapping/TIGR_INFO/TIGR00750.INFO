CC  In E. coli, mutation of this kinase blocks phosphorylation of two transporter system periplasmic binding proteins and consequently inhibits those transporters. This kinase is also found in Gram-positive bacteria, archaea, and the roundworm C. elegans. It may have a more general, but still unknown function.
CC  Mutations have also been found that do not phosphorylate the periplasmic binding proteins, yet still allow transport. The ATPase activity of this protein seems to be necessary, however.
