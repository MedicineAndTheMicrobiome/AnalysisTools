CC  This protein family was identified, by the method of partial phylogenetic profiling, as related to the use of tetrahydromethanopterin (H4MPT) as a C-1 carrier. Characteristic markers of the H4MPT-linked C1 transfer pathway include formylmethanofuran dehydrogenase subunits, methenyltetrahydromethanopterin cyclohydrolase, etc. Tetrahydromethanopterin, a tetrahydrofolate analog, occurs in methanogenic archaea, bacterial methanotrophs, planctomycetes, and a few other lineages.
