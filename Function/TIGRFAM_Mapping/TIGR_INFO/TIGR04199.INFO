CC  Exosortase J occurs as a three-member paralogous family in Acidobacterium sp. MP5ACTX8. It contains an N-terminal exosortase/archaeosortase domain and a novel C-terminal domain comprising about half of total protein length. The presumptive target, found as an adjacent gene for two of the three paralogs, consists of a possible lipoprotein signal peptide followed almost immediately by a C-terminal region with some PEP-CTERM-like characteristics.
