CC  This HMM represents CysT, one of two homologous, tandem permeases in the sulfate ABC transporter system; the other is CysW (TIGR02140). The sulfate transporter has been described in E. coli as transporting sulfate, thiosulfate, selenate, and selenite. Sulfate transporters may also transport molybdate ion if a specific molybdate transporter is not present.
