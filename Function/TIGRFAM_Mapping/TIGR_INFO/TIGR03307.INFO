CC  This family of proteins found in operons encoding phosphonate C-P lyase systems as is observed in E. coli [1] and is a member of the metallo-beta-lactamase superfamily (PF00753).  As defined by this model, all instances of this protein are associated with the C-P lyase, but not all genomes containing the C-P lyase system contain phnP.
