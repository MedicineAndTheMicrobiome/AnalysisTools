CC  Members of this family appear to be SAM-dependent O-methyltransferases acting on sugars, based on iterated sequence searches and gene context. Members occur in Leptospira O-antigen regions, as well NanM from the biosynthesis cluster for nanchangmycin, which produces 4-O-methyl-L-rhodinose as an intermediate.
