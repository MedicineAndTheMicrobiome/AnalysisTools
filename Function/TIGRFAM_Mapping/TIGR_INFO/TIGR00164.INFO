TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  Phosphatidylserine decarboxylase is synthesized as a single chain precursor. Generation of the pyruvoyl active site from a Ser is coupled to cleavage of a Gly-Ser bond between the larger (beta) and smaller (alpha chains). It is an integral membrane protein. This protein has many regions of homology to known phosphatidylserine decarboxylases, including the Gly-Ser motif for chain cleavage and active site generation, but has a shorter amino end and a number of deletions along the length of the alignment to the phosphatidylserine decarboxylases.
CC  It is unclear whether this protein is a form of phosphatidylserine decarboxylase or is a related enzyme. It is found in Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and several archaeal species, all of which lack known phosphatidylserine decarboxylase.
