CC  Members of this protein family, found in a subset of nitrogen-fixing bacteria, are the nitrogen fixation protein NifM. NifM, homologous to peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerases, appears to be an accessory protein for NifH, the Fe protein, also called component II or dinitrogenase reductase, of nitrogenase.
