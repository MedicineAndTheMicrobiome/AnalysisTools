CC  This HMM represents the class II family of 3-deoxy-7-phosphoheptulonate synthase, aka phospho-2-dehydro-3-deoxyheptonate aldolase, as found in plants and some bacteria. It shows some similarity to the class I family found in many bacteria. The enzyme catalyzes the first of 7 steps in the biosynthesis of chorismate, that last common precursor of all three aromatic amino acids.
CC  Homologs scoring between trusted and noise cutoff include proteins involved in antibiotic biosynthesis; one example is active as this enzyme, while another acts on an amino analog.
