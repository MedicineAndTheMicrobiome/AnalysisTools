CC  The related but duplicated, double-length protein SppA (protease IV) of E. coli was shown experimentally to degrade signal peptides as are released by protein processing and secretion. This protein shows stronger homology to the C-terminal region of SppA than to the N-terminal domain or to the related putative protease SuhB.
CC  The member of this family from Bacillus subtilis was shown to have properties consistent with a role in degrading signal peptides after cleavage from precursor proteins, although it was not demonstrated conclusively.
