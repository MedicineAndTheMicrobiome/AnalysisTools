CC  This model represents an enzyme family in which members are designated either butryate kinase or branched-chain carboxylic acid kinase. The EC designation 2.7.2.7 describes an enzyme with relatively broad specificity; gene products whose context suggests a role in metabolism of aliphatic amino acids are likely to act as branched-chain carboxylic acid kinase. The gene typically found adjacent, ptb (phosphate butyryltransferase), likewise encodes an enzyme that may have a broad specificity that includes a role in aliphatic amino acid cabolism.
