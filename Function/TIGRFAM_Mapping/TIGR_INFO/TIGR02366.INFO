EN  probable dihydroxyacetone kinase regulator
TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  The seed alignment for this family was built from a set of closely related uncharacterized proteins associated with operons for the type of bacterial dihydroxyacetone kinase that transfers PEP-derived phosphate from a phosphoprotein, as in phosphotransferase system transport, rather than from ATP. Members have a TetR transcriptional regulator domain (PF00440) at the N-terminus and sequence homology throughout.
