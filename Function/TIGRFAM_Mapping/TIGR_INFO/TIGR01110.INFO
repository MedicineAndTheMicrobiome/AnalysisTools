CC  This model describes malonate decarboxylase alpha subunit, from both the water-soluble form as found in Klebsiella pneumoniae and the form couple to sodium ion pumping in Malonomonas rubra. Malonate decarboxylase Na+ pump is the paradigm of the family of Na+ transport decarboxylases. Essentially, it couples the energy derived from decarboxylation of a carboxylic acid substrate to move Na+ ion across the bilayer. Functional malonate decarboylase is a multi subunit protein. The alpha subunit enzymatically performs the transfer of malonate (substrate) to an acyl carrier protein subunit for subsequent decarboxylation, hence the name: acetyl-S-acyl carrier protein:malonate carrier protein-SH transferase.
