CC  The proteins represented by this model contain three RNA recognition motifs (rrm: PF00076) and have been characterized as poly-pyrimidine tract binding proteins associated with RNA splicing factors [1,2,3].
CC  In the case of PUF60 (GP|6176532), in complex with p54, and in the presence of U2AF, facilitates association of U2 snRNP with pre-mRNA [2].
