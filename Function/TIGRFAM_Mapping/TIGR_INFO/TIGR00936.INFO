CC  This enzyme hydrolyzes adenosylhomocysteine as part of a cycle for the regeneration of the methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine. Species that lack this enzyme are likely to have adenosylhomocysteine nucleosidase (EC 3.2.2.9), an enzyme which also acts as 5'-methyladenosine nucleosidase (see TIGR01704).
