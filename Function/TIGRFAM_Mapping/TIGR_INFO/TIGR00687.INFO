CC  E. coli has an enzyme PdxK that acts in vitro as a  pyridoxine/pyridoxal/pyridoxamine kinase, but mutants lacking PdxK activity retain a specific pyridoxal kinase, PdxY. PdxY acts in the salvage pathway of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate biosynthesis. Mammalian forms of pyridoxal kinase are more similar to PdxY than to PdxK. The PdxK isozyme is omitted from the seed alignment but scores above the trusted cutoff.
CC  ThiD and related proteins form an outgroup.
