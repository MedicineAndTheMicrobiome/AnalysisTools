CC  This gene is part of the type I restriction and modification system which is composed of three polypeptides R (restriction endonuclease), M (modification) and S (specificity). This group of enzymes recognize specific short DNA sequences and have an absolute requirement for ATP (or dATP) and S-adenosyl-L-methionine. They also catalyse the reactions of EC 2.1.1.72 and EC 2.1.1.73, with similar site specificity.(J. Mol. Biol. 271 (3), 342-348 (1997)).
CC  Members of this family are assumed to differ from each other in DNA site specificity.
