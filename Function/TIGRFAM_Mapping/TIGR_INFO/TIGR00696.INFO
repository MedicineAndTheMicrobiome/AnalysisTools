CC  The WecG member of this superfamily, believed to be UDP-N-acetyl-D-mannosaminuronic acid transferase, plays a role in enterobacterial common antigen (eca) synthesis in Escherichia coli. Another family member, the Bacillus subtilis TagA protein, is involved in the biosynthesis of the cell wall polymer poly(glycerol phosphate). The third family member, CpsF, CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid synthetase has a role in the capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis pathway.
