CC  This HMM represents the N-terminal half of a family of Streptococcal proteins that contain a signal peptide and then up to five repeats of a region that includes a His-X-X-His-X-His (histidine triad) motif. Three repeats are found in the seed alignment. Additional copies in more poorly conserved regions can be detected because this is a fragment-mode HMM. Members of this family from Streptococcus pneumoniae are suggested to cleave human C3, and the member PhpA has been shown in vaccine studies to be a protective antigen in  mice.

RT  Recombinant PhpA protein, a unique histidine motif-containing protein from Streptococcus pneumoniae, protects mice against intranasal pneumococcal challenge.
