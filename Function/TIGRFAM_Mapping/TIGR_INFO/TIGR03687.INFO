CC  Members of this protein family are Pup, a small protein whose ligation to target proteins steers them toward degradation. This protein family occurs in a number of bacteria, especially Actinobacteria such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, that possess an archeal-type proteasome. All members of this protein family known during model construction end with the C-terminal motif [FY][VI]QKGG[QE]. Ligation is thought to occur between the C-terminal COOH of Pup and an epsilon-amino group of a Lys on the target protein. The N-terminal half of this protein is poorly conserved and not represented in the seed alignment.
