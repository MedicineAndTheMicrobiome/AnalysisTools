CC  This model represents a clade of sequences within the pseudouridine synthase superfamily (PF00849).  The superfamily includes E. coli proteins: RluA, RluB, RluC, RluD, and RsuA.  The sequences modeled here are most closely related to RluA [1].  Neisseria, among those species hitting this model, does not appear to have an RluA homolog.  It is presumed that these sequences function as pseudouridine synthases, although perhaps with different specificity.
