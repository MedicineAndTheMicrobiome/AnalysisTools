CC  Members of this family are prenytransferases that modify mostly, perhaps exclusively, ribosomally derived cyclic peptides. Note that in some cases, the natural product becomes C-prenylated through a non-enzymatic rearrangement after initial O-prenylation. Prenylated products carry names such as prenylagaramide, anacyclamide, and piricyclamide.
