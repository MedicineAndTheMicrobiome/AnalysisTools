CC  Essentially all bacteria have a member of the YidC family, whose C-terminal domain is modeled by TIGR03592. The two copies are found in endospore-forming bacteria such as Bacillus subtilis appear redundant during vegetative growth, although the member designated spoIIIJ (stage III sporulation protein J) has a distinct role in spore formation. YidC, its mitochondrial homolog Oxa1, and its chloroplast homolog direct insertion into the bacterial/organellar inner (or only) membrane. This model describes an N-terminal sequence region, including a large periplasmic domain lacking in YidC members from Gram-positive species. The multifunctional YidC protein acts both with and independently of the Sec system.
