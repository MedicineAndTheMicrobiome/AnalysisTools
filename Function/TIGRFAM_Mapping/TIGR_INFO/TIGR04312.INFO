CC  This domain, about 385 amino acids long, can have either of at least two types of C-terminal sorting signal. Members from Shewanella and allies have the rhombosortase target domain GlyGly-CTERM (TIGR03501), while members of the Bacteroidetes have the Por secretion system C-terminal domain (TIGR04183). Most other members lack any C-terminal extension, but in most of those, the normal signal sequence is replaced by a lipoprotein signal sequence. Member sequences show a region of local similarity to the LVIVD repeat sequence (PF08309).
