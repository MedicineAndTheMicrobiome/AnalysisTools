CC  A family of closely related, thiamine pyrophosphate-dependent enzymes includes indolepyruvate decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.74), phenylpyruvate decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.43), pyruvate decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.1), branched-chain alpha-ketoacid decarboxylase, etc.. Members of this group of homologs may overlap in specificity. This model represents a clade that includes a Azospirillum brasilense member active as both phenylpyruvate decarboxylase and indolepyruvate decarboxylase.
