CC  Members of this protein family are PspF, the sigma-54-dependent transcriptional activator of the phage shock protein (psp) operon, in Escherichia coli and numerous other species. The psp operon is induced by a number of stress conditions, including heat shock, ethanol, and filamentous phage infection.  Changed com_name to adhere to TIGR role notes conventions. 09/15/06 - DMH
