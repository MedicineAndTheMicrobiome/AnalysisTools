CC  This model describes a paralogous family with at least ten members in Verrucomicrobium spinosum. Two additional predicted proteins match more weakly and score between the trusted and noise cutoffs, while a third contains a point mutation. Eleven of the thirteen genes are found in a single tandem array.
