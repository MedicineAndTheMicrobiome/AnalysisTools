CC  This model describes a periplasmic c-type cytochrome that serves as the primary electron acceptor for the quinoprotein methanol dehydrogenase, a PQQ enzyme. The member from Paracoccus denitrificans is also characterized as an electron acceptor for methylamine dehydrogenase, a tryptophan tryptophylquinone enzyme. This protein is called cytochrome c(L) in methylotrophic bacteria such Methylobacterium extorquens, but c551i in Paracoccus denitrificans.
