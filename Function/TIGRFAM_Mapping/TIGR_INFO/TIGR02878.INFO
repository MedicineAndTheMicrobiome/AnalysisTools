CC  Members of this protein, YpjB, family are restricted to a subset of endospore-forming bacteria, including Bacillus species but not CLostridium or some others. In Bacillus subtilis, ypjB was found to be part of the sigma-E regulon, where sigma-E is a sporulation sigma factor that regulates expression in the mother cell compartment. Null mutants of ypjB show a sporulation defect. This protein family is not, however, a part of the endospore formation minimal gene set.
