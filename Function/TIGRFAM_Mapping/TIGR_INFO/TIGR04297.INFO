CC  This member of the archaeosortase/exosortase family occurs exclusively in the Thaumarchaeota, where the corresponding proposed sorting signal is PEFG-CTERM (see model TIGR04296). This family is unusual in that the suspected active site residue, Cys in every other defined subfamily of archaeosortases and exosortases is replaced by Ser.
