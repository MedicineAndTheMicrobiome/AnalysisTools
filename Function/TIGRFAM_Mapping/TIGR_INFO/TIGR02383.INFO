CC  This model represents the RNA-binding pleiotropic regulator Hfq, a small, Sm-like protein of bacteria. It helps pair regulatory noncoding RNAs with complementary mRNA target regions. It enhances the elongation of poly(A) tails on mRNA. It appears also to protect RNase E recognition sites (A/U-rich sequences with adjacent stem-loop structures) from cleavage. Being pleiotropic, it differs in some of its activities in different species. Hfq binds the non-coding regulatory RNA DsrA (see Rfam RF00014) in the few species known to have it: Escherichia coli, Shigella flexneri, Salmonella spp.  In Azorhizobium caulinodans, an hfq mutant is unable to express nifA, and Hfq is called NrfA, for nif regulatory factor (see PMID:8197116). The name hfq reflects phenomenology as a host factor for phage Q-beta RNA replication.
