CC  Catabolite control protein A is a LacI family global transcriptional regulator found in Gram-positive bacteria.  CcpA is involved in repressing carbohydrate utilization genes [ex: alpha-amylase (amyE), acetyl-coenzyme A synthase (acsA)] and in activating genes involved in transporting excess carbon from the cell [ex: acetate kinase (ackA), alpha-acetolactate synthase (alsS)]. Additionally, disruption of CcpA in Bacillus megaterium, Staphylococcus xylosus, Lactobacillus casei and Lactocacillus pentosus also decreases growth rate, which suggests CcpA is involved in the regulation of other metabolic pathways.
