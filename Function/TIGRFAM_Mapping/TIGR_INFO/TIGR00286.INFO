CC  The three copies present in Archeoglobus fulgidus, one of which is only half-length and excluded from the seed alignment, are very closely related and clearly arose by duplication after the separation from well-studied species. The other completed archaeal genomes each contain a single copy. The lone, weak (below trusted cutoff) hit to a non-archaeal sequence is to an uncharacterized protein of Chlamydia, with the greatest similarity in the amino-terminal half of the model.
