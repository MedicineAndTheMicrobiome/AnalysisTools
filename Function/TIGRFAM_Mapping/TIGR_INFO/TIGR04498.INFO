CC  This family includes AbiV (abortive infection system V) from Lactococcus lactis, a phage resistance protein that causes certain phage infections to fail to lead to successful phage replication. Abortive infection mechanisms differ greatly. AbiV interacts directly with the protein SaV in phage p2 and blocks translation of phage proteins.
