EN  Actinobacterial PQQ system protein
TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  Members of this protein family are restricted to members of the Actinobacteria (Mycobacterium smegmatis, Streptomyces hygroscopicus, Geodermatophilus obscurus, Pseudonocardia dioxanivorans, Saccharomonospora marina, etc) that synthesize PQQ. This small protein, 155 amino acids long on average, is found regularly next to a much larger protein, a PQQ-dependent oxidoreductase, and might be a companion subunit or an accessory protein such as chaperone involved in cofactor insertion.
