CC  The MMP1680 protein from Methanococcus maripaludis has been characterized as the archaeal protein responsible for the second step of UDP-GlcNAc biosynthesis [1].  This GlmM protein catalyzes the conversion of glucosamine-6-phosphate to glucosamine-1-phosphate.  The first-characterized bacterial GlmM protein is modeled by TIGR01455.  These two families are members of the larger phosphoglucomutase/phosphomannomutase family (characterized by three domains: PF02878, PF02879 and PF02880), but are not nearest neighbors to each other.
CC  This model also includes a number of sequences from non-archaea in the Bacteroides, Chlorobi, Chloroflexi, Planctomycetes and Spirochaetes lineages.  Evidence supporting their inclusion in this equivalog as having the same activity comes from genomic context and phylogenetic profiling.  A large number of these organisms are known to produce exo-polysaccharide and yet only appeared to contain the GlmS enzyme of the GlmSMU pathway for UDP-GlcNAc biosynthesis (GenProp0750).  In some organisms including Leptospira, this archaeal GlmM is found adjacent to the GlmS as well as a putative GlmU non-orthologous homolog.  Phylogenetic profiling of the GlmS-only pattern using PPP [2] identifies members of this archaeal GlmM family as the highest-scoring result.
