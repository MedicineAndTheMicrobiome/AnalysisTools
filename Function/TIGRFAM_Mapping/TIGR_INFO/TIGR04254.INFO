TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  Representatives of this family include a 13-member paralogous family of proteins about 215 amino acids in length from the termite gut bacterium Opitutaceae bacterium TAV2, a member of the Verrucomicrobia. The signal peptide (N-terminal) and PEP-CTERM putative protein sorting signal (C-terminal) are not included in the seed alignment. Conserved residues such as an invariant Arg and a lack of conspicuous low-complexity sequence suggest a globular structure and possible enzymatic activity. Members average about thirty percent sequence identify overall, but over seventy percent in the PEP-CTERM region. The function of this family is unknown.
