CC  This protein describes a multidomain ABC transporter subunit that is one of three protein families associated with some regularity with a distinctive family of putative bacteriocins. It includes a bacteriocin-processing peptidase domain at the N-terminus. Model TIGR03793 describes a conserved propeptide region for this bacteriocin family, unusual because it shows obvious homology a region of the enzyme nitrile hydratase up to the classic Gly-Gly cleavage motif. This family is therefore predicted to be a subunit of a bacteriocin processing and export system characteristic to this system that we designate NHLM, Nitrile Hydratase Leader Microcin.
