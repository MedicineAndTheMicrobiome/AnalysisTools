CC  This HMM represents a superfamily of probable transcriptional regulators. One member, RRF2 of Desulfovibrio vulgaris is an apparent regulatory protein experimentally (MEDLINE:97293189). The N-terminal region appears related to the DNA-binding biotin repressor region of the BirA bifunctional according to results after three rounds of PSI-BLAST with a fairly high stringency.
