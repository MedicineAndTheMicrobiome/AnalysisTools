CC  This family of ornithine carbamoyltransferases (OTCase) is in a superfamily with the related enzyme aspartate carbamoyltransferase. Most known examples are anabolic, playing a role in arginine biosynthesis, but some are catabolic.
CC  Most OTCases are homotrimers, but the homotrimers are organized into dodecamers built from four trimers in at least two species; the catabolic OTCase of Pseudomonas aeruginosa is allosterically regulated, while OTCase of the extreme thermophile Pyrococcus furiosus shows both allostery and thermophily.
