CC  This family represents the oligoendopeptidase F clade of the family of larger M3 or thimet (for thiol-dependent metallopeptidase) oligopeptidase family. Lactococcus lactis PepF hydrolyzed peptides of 7 and 17 amino acids with fairly broad specificity. The homolog of lactococcal PepF in group B Streptococcus was named PepB (PMID:8757883), with the name difference reflecting a difference in species of origin rather activity; substrate profiles were quite similar.  Differences in substrate specificity should be expected in other species. The gene is duplicated in Lactococcus lactis on the plasmid that bears it. A shortened second copy is found in Bacillus subtilis.
