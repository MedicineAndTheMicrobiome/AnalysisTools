CC  This HMM describes a proteobacterial subset of succinyl-diaminopimelate desuccinylases. An experimentally confirmed Gram-positive lineage succinyl-diaminopimelate desuccinylase has been described for Corynebacterium glutamicum (SP:Q59284), and a neighbor-joining tree shows the seed members, SP:Q59284, and putative archaeal members such as TrEMBL:O58003 in a single clade. However, the archaeal members differ substantially, share a number of motifs with acetylornithine deacetylases rather than succinyl-diaminopimelate desuccinylases, and are not taken as trusted examples of  succinyl-diaminopimelate desuccinylases. This model is limited to proteobacterial members for this reason.
