CC  This protein, LolA, is known so far only in the gamma and beta subdivisions of the Proteobacteria. The E. coli major outer lipoprotein (Lpp) of E. coli is released from the inner membrane as a complex with this chaperone in an energy-requiring process, and is then delivered to LolB for insertion into the outer membrane. LolA is involved in the delivery of lipoproteins generally, rather than just Lpp, and is an essential protein in E. coli, unlike Lpp itself.
