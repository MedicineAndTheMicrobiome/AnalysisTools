TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  Members of this family include TlyA from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, an rRNA methylase whose modifications are necessary to confer sensitivity to ribosome-targeting antibiotics capreomycin and viomycin. Homology supports identification as a methyltransferase. However, a parallel literature persists in calling some members hemolysins. Hemolysins are exotoxins that attack blood cell membranes and cause cell rupture, often by forming a pore in the membrane. A recent study (2013) on SCO1782 from Streptomyces coelicolor shows hemolysin activity as earlier described for a homolog from the spirochete Serpula (Treponema) hyodysenteriae and one from Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
