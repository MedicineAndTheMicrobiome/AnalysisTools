CC  This model includes a small protein encoded by one of two genes, both downstream of the gene rpoN for sigma 54, whose deletion leads to increased expression from sigma 54-dependent promoters. It also includes the N-terminal half of a light-repressed protein LtrA of Synechococcus PCC 7002 and the N-terminal region (after removal of the transit peptide) of a larger plastid-specific ribosomal protein of spinach.
CC  The member of this family from E. coli is now recognized as a protein at the interace between ribosomal large and small subunits, with about 1/3 as many copies per cell as the number of ribosomes.
