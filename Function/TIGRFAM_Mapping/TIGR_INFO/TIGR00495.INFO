CC  Proteins identified by this HMM have been identified in a number of species as a nuclear (but not nucleolar) protein with a cell cycle dependence. Various names given to members of this family have included cell cycle protein p38-2G4, DNA-binding protein GBP16, and proliferation-associated protein 1. This protein is closely related to methionine aminopeptidase, a cobolt-binding protein.
