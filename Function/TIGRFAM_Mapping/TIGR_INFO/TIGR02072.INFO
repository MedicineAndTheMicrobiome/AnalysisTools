CC  This enzyme, which is found in biotin biosynthetic gene clusters in proteobacteria, firmicutes, green-sulfur bacteria, fusobacterium and bacteroides, carries out an enzymatic step prior to the formation of pimeloyl-CoA, namely O-methylation of the malonyl group preferentially while on acyl carrier protein.  The enzyme is recognizable as a methyltransferase by homology.
