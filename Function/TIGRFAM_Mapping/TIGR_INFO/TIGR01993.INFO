CC  This family of proteins includes the SDT1/SSM1 gene from yeast which has been shown to code for a pyrimidine (UMP/CMP) 5'nucleotidase.  The family spans plants, fungi and a small number of bacteria.
CC  These enzymes are members of the haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily of hydrolases, specifically the IA subfamily (variant 3, TIGR01509).
