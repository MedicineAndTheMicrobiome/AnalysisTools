CC  Members of this family are the WecA enzyme of enterobacterial common antigen biosynthesis, undecaprenyl-phosphate alpha-N-acetylglucosaminyl 1-phosphatetransferase. This family represents one narrow clade, and closely related sequences outside this clade may represent enzymes that catalyze the same specific reaction, but in the context of different pathways. A His-rich motif in a cytosolic loop of this integral membrane protein, shown critical to enzymatic activity for WecA (see ref [1]) is variously present or absent in the clade that includes Bacillus subtilis TagO teichoic acid biosynthesis enzyme, which may catalyze the same reaction as WecA.

RT  Conserved amino acid residues found in a predicted cytosolic domain of the lipopolysaccharide biosynthetic protein WecA are implicated in the recognition of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine.
