CC  Members of this protein family belong to the family of polysaccharide chain length determinant proteins (PF02706). All are found in species that encode the PEP-CTERM/exosortase system predicted to act in protein sorting in a number of Gram-negative bacteria, and are found near the epsH homolog that is the putative exosortase gene.
