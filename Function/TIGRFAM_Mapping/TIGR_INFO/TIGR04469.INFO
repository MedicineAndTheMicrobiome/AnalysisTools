CC  Members of this family are related to cytosylglucuronate (CGA) synthase (TIGR04466), and found in the same clusters as CGA synthase and CGA decarboxylase. These clusters produce peptidyl nucleoside antibiotics with a pyranoside core moiety, found in a number of Streptomyces species. Removal of the S. griseochromogenes member of this family, BlsF, from a heterologous expression system caused an increase, not blockage, of blasticidin S.
