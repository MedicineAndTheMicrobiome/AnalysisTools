CC  This model identifies proteins of two distinct names which may or may not have two distinct functions.
CC  CitB [1] has been identified in salmonella and E. coli as the signal transduction component of a two-component system for citrate in which CitA acts as a citrate transporter.
CC  CobZ is essential for cobalamin biosynthesis (by knockout of the R. capsulatus gene [2]) and is complemented by the characterized precorrin 3B synthase CobG.  The enzyme has been shown to contain flavin, heme and Fe-S cluster cofactors and is believed to require dioxygen as a substrate.  This model identifies the C-terminal domain of the R. capsulatus CobZ, which, in most other species exists as a separate gene adjacent to CobZ.
