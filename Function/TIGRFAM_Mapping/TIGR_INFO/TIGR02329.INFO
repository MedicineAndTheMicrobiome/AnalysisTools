CC  At least five distinct pathways exists for the catabolism of propionate by way of propionyl-CoA. Members of this family represent the transcriptional regulatory protein PrpR, whose gene is found in most cases divergently transcribed from an operon for the methylcitric acid cycle of propionate catabolism. 2-methylcitric acid, a catabolite by this pathway, is a coactivator of PrpR.
