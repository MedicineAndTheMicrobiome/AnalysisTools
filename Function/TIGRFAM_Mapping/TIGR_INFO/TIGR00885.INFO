CC  This family describes the L-fucose permease in bacteria. L-fucose(6-deoxy-L-galactose) is a monosaccharide found in glycoproteins and cell wall polysaccharides. L-fucose is used in bacteria through an inducible pathway mediated by atleast four enzymes: a permease, isomerase, kinase and an aldolase which are encoded by fucP, fucI, fucK, fucA respectively. The fuc genes belong to a regulon comprising of four linked operons: fucO, fucA, fucPIK and fucR. The positive regulator is encoded by fucR, whose protein responds to fuculose-1-phosphate, which acts as an effector.
