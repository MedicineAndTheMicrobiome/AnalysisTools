CC  This model describes DMC1, a subfamily of a larger family of DNA repair and recombination proteins. It is eukaryotic only and most closely related to eukaryotic RAD51. It also resembles archaeal RadA (TIGR02236) and RadB (TIGR02237) and bacterial RecA (TIGR02012). It has been characterized for human as a recombinase active only in meiosis.
