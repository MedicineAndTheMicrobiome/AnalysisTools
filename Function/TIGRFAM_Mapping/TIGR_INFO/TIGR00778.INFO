CC  This HMM represents a 51-residue core region of homology among a family of mostly uncharacterized proteins of 110 to 227 amino acids.
CC  Most members of this family contain the motif EXXXXXX[SA]XXXXXC[VIL]XCXXXH.
CC  Members of the family include the alkylhydroperoxidase AhpD of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, a macrophage infectivity potentiator peptide of Legionella pneumophila, and an uncharacterized peptide in the tetrachloroethene reductive dehalogenase operon of Dehalospirillum multivorans. We suggest that many peptides containing this domain may have alkylhydroperoxidase or related antioxidant activity.
