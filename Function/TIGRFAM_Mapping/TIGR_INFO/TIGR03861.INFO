CC  Members of this protein family, part of a larger class of efflux-type ABC transport permease proteins, are found exclusively in genomic contexts with  pyrroloquinoline-quinone (PQQ) biosynthesis enzymes and/or PQQ-dependent alcohol dehydrogenases, such as the phenylethanol dehydrogenase PedE of Pseudomonas putida U. Members include PedC, an apparent phenylethanol transport protein whose suggested role is efflux to limit intracellular concentrations of toxic metabolites during phenylethanol catalysis.
