CC  Members of this family of GHMP kinases were previously designated as conserved hypothetical protein YchB or as isopentenyl monophosphate kinase. It is now known, in tomato and E. coli, to encode 4-diphosphocytidyl-2C-methyl-D-erythritol kinase, an enzyme of the deoxyxylulose phosphate pathway of terpenoid biosynthesis.
