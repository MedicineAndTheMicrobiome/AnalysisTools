CC  Members of this family are found in C. elegans, Synechocystis sp., E. coli, and several of the Archaea. Members in Cyanobacteria have been shown to play a role in protein complex biogenesis, and designated BtpA (biogenesis of thylakoid protein). Homologs in non-photosynthetic species, where thylakoid intracytoplasmic membranes are lacking, are likely to act elsewhere in membrane protein biogenesis.
