CC  This model describes the ComEA protein in bacteria. The com E locus is obligatory for bacterial cell competence - the process of internalizing the exogenous added DNA. Lesions in the loci has been variously described for the appearance of competence-related pheonotypes and impairment of competence, suggesting their intimate functional role in bacterial transformation.
