EN  photosystem II S4 domain protein
TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  Members of this protein family are about 265 residues long and each contains an S4 RNA-binding domain of about 48 residues. The member from the Cyanobacterium, Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, was detected as a novel polypeptide in a highly purified preparation of active photosystem II (Kashino, et al., 2002). The phylogenetic distribution, including Cyanobacteria and Arabidopsis, supports a role in photosystem II, although the high bit score cutoffs for this model reflect similar sequences in non-photosynthetic organisms such as Carboxydothermus hydrogenoformans, a Gram-positive bacterium.
