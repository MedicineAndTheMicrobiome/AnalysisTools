TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  This protein is predicted to have 10 transmembrane regions. Members of this family are found so far in the Archaea (Archaeoglobus fulgidus and Pyrococcus horikoshii) and in a bacterial thermophile, Thermotoga maritima. In Pyrococcus, the gene is located between nadA and nadB, two components of an enzyme involved in de novo synthesis of NAD. By PSI-BLAST, this family shows similarity (but not necessarily homology) to gluconate permease and other transport proteins.
