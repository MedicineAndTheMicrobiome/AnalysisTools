CC  Members of this family, aminodeoxychorismate synthase, component I (PabB), were designated para-aminobenzoate synthase component I until it was recognized that PabC, a lyase, completes the pathway of PABA synthesis. This family is closely related to anthranilate synthase component I (trpE), and both act on chorismate. The clade of PabB enzymes represented by this model includes sequences from Gram-positive and alpha and gamma Proteobacteria as well as Chlorobium, Nostoc, Fusobacterium and Arabidopsis.  A closely related clade of fungal PabB enzymes is identified by TIGR01823, while another bacterial clade of potential PabB enzymes is more closely related to TrpE (TIGR01824).
