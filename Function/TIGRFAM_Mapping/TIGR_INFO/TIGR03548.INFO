CC  Members of this protein family show essentially full-length homology, cyclically permuted, to YjhT from Escherichia coli. YjhT was shown to act as a mutarotase for sialic acid, and by this ability to be able to act as a virulence factor. Members of the YjhT family (TIGR03547) and this cyclically-permuted family have multiple repeats of the beta-propeller-forming Kelch repeat.
