CC  This HMM represents a family of hypothetical proteins, half of which are 40 residues or less in length. Members are found only in spore-forming species. A Gly-rich variable region is followed by a strongly conserved, highly hydrophobic region, predicted to form a transmembrane helix, ending with an invariant Gly. The consensus for this stretch is FALLVVFILLIIV.
