CC  This HMM, eIF-2B_rel, describes half of a superfamily, where the other half consists of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2B (eIF-2B) subunits alpha, beta, and delta. It is unclear whether the eIF-2B_rel set is monophyletic, or whether they are all more closely related to each other than to any eIF-2B subunit because the eIF-2B clade is highly derived.  Members of this branch of the family are all uncharacterized with respect to function and are found in the Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya, although a number are described as putative translation intiation factor components. Proteins found by eIF-2B_rel include at least three clades, including a set of uncharacterized eukaryotic proteins, a set found in some but not all Archaea, and a set universal so far among the Archaea and closely related to several uncharacterized bacterial proteins.
