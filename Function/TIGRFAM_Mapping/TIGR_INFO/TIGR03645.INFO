CC  Members of this protein family share homology with lactoylglutathione lyase (glyoxalase I) and are found mainly in marine members of the gammaproteobacteria, including CPS_0532 from Colwellia psychrerythraea 34H. This family excludes a well-separated, more narrowly distributed paralogous family, exemplified by CPS_3492 from C. psychrerythraea. The function is of this protein family is unknown.
