CC  The IspH protein (previously designated LytB) has now been recognized as the last enzyme in the biosynthesis of isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP).
CC  Escherichia coli LytB protein had been found to regulate the activity of RelA (guanosine 3',5'-bispyrophosphate synthetase I), which in turn controls the level of a regulatory metabolite. It is involved in penicillin tolerance and the stringent response.
