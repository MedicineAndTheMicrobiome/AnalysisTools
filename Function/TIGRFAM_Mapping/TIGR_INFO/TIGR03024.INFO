CC  This domain, distantly related to the PEP-Cterm domain described in model TIGR02595, is found in Methanosarcina mazei in four different proteins, as well as in other archaea such as Methanococcoides burtonii. Several proteins with this domain have their genes only a short distance from archaeosortase C, a proposed integral membrane transpeptidase. This family should exclude members of the PEFG-CTERM domain family (TIGR04296), specific to the Thaumarchaeota.
