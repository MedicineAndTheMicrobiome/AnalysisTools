CC  This HMM represents the full length of bacterial cell division protein ZipA. The N-terminal hydrophobic stretch is an uncleaved signal-anchor sequence. This is followed by an unconserved, variable length, low complexity region, and then a conserved C-terminal region of about 140 amino acids (see PF04354) that interacts with the tubulin-like cell division protein FtsZ.
