CC  Also called gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (ggt). Some members of this family  have antibiotic synthesis or resistance activities. In the case of a cephalosporin acylase from Pseudomonas sp., the enzyme was shown to retain some gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase activity.  Other, more distantly related proteins have ggt-related activities and score below the trusted cutoff.
