CC  The model when searched with a partial length search brings in proteins with a dinucleotide-binding motif (Rossman fold) over the initial 40 residues of the model, including oxidoreductases and dehydrogenases. Partially characterized members include an FAD-binding protein from Bacillus cereus and flavoprotein HI0933 from Haemophilus influenzae.
