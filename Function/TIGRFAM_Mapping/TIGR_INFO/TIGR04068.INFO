CC  Members of this family are radical SAM enzymes that occur next to clostridial Cys-rich predicted bacteriocin (or other class of ribosomal natural product) precursors (see families TIGR04065 and TIGR04067). They include a TIGR04085 C-terminal additional 4Fe4S cluster-binding domain that is associated with peptide modification by radical SAM enzymes, and they are proposed to be ribosomal natural product maturases. The gene symbol ccpM is assigned, for Clostridial Cys-rich Peptide Maturase.
