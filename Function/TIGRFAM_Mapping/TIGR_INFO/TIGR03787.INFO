CC  This model describes a family of DNA-binding response regulator proteins, associated with an adjacent histidine kinase (TIGR03785) to form a two-component system. This system co-occurs with, and often is adjacent to, a proteobacterial variant form of the protein sorting transpeptidase called sortase (TIGR03784), and a single target protein for the sortase. We give this protein the gene symbol pdsR, for Proteobacterial Dedicated Sortase system Response regulator.
