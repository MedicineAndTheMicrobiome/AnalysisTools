CC  Members of this family  average 75 amino acids in length and average six instances of the motif ACGX, where X is A, S, or T. Members are proposed target sequences for modification by adjacent radical SAM/SPASM domain proteins (family TIGR04340). Cys residues adjacent to Gly residues are common as proposed sites for modification by radical SAM enzymes.
