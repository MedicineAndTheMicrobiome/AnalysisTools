CC  This model represents a clade of probable zinc dipeptidases, closely related to the characterized non-specific dipeptidase, PepV.  Many enzymes in this clade have been given names including the terms "Xaa-His" and "carnosinase" due to the early mis-characterization of the Lactobacillus delbrueckii PepV enzyme.  These names are likely too specific.
