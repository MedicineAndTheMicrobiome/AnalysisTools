CC  Members of this family are heme utilization proteins, typically designated HutZ. They are members of the PPOX family (PF01243) and, except for the lack of an N-terminal extension, are closely related to one form of heme oxidase (1.14.99.3), HugZ (TIGR04109). Members typically are found in a three-gene operon with radical SAM enzyme HutW and a protein of unknown function, HutX.
