CC  This HMM represents the most well-conserved core of a set of chromosomal and plasmid partition proteins related to ParB, including Spo0J, RepB, and SopB. Spo0J has been shown to bind a specific DNA sequence that, when introduced into a plasmid, can serve as partition site. Study of RepB, which has nicking-closing activity, suggests that it forms a transient protein-DNA covalent intermediate during the strand transfer reaction.
