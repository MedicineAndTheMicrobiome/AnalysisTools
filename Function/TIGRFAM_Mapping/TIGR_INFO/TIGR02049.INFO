CC  This family consists of a rare family of glutamate--cysteine ligases, demonstrated first in Thiobacillus ferrooxidans and present in a few other Proteobacteria. It is the first of two enzymes for glutathione biosynthesis. It is also called gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase.
RM  8828222
RT  The gene for gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase from Thiobacillus ferrooxidans has low homology to its Escherichia coli equivalent and is linked to the gene for citrate synthase.
