CC  Members of this protein family are 4-oxalocrotonate decarboxylase. Note that this protein, as characterized (indirectly) in Pseudomonas sp. strain CF600, was inactive except when coexpressed with DmpE, 2-oxopent-4-enoate hydratase, a homologous protein from the same operon. Both of these enzymes are active in the degradation of catechol, a common intermediate in the degradation of aromatic compounds such as benzoate, toluene, phenol, dimethylphenol (dmp), salicylate, etc.
