CC  This HMM describes phosphoribosylglycinamide formyltransferase (GAR transformylase), one of several proteins in formyl_transf (Pfam family PF00551). This enzyme uses formyl tetrahydrofolate as a formyl group donor to produce 5'-phosphoribosyl-N-formylglycinamide. PurT, a different GAR transformylase, uses ATP and formate rather than formyl tetrahydrofolate. Experimental proof includes complementation of E. coli purN mutants by orthologs from vertebrates (where it is a domain of a multifunctional protein), Bacillus subtilis, and Arabidopsis.
CC  No archaeal example was detected.
CC  In phylogenetic analyses, the member from Saccharomyces cerevisiae shows a long branch length but membership in the family, while the formyltetrahydrofolate deformylases form a closely related outgroup.
