CC  The delineation of this family was based in part on a discussion and neighbor-joining phylogenetic study, by Kyrpides and Woese, of archaeal and other proteins homologous to the alpha, beta, and delta subunits of eukaryotic initiation factor 2B (eIF-2B), a five-subunit molecule that catalyzes GTP recycling for eIF-2. This clade is now recognized to include the methionine salvage pathway enzyme MtnA.
