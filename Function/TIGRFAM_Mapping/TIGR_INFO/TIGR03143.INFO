CC  This family of thioredoxin reductase homologs is found adjacent to alkylhydroperoxide reductase C subunit predominantly in cases where there is only one C subunit in the genome and that genome is lacking the F subunit partner (also a thioredcxin reductase homolog) that is usually found (TIGR03140).
