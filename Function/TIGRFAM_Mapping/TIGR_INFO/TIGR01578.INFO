CC  This clade of sequences is closely related to MiaB, a modifier of isopentenylated adenosine-37 of certain eukaryotic and bacterial tRNAs (see TIGR01574 [1,2,3]).
CC  Sequence alignments suggest that this equivalog performs the same chemical transformation as MiaB, perhaps on a different (or differently modified) tRNA base substrate.
CC  This clade is a member of a subfamily (TIGR00089) and spans the archaea and eukaryotes.  The only archaeal miaB-like genes are in this clade, while eukaryotes have sequences described by this HMM as well as ones falling within the scope of the MiaB equivalog model.
