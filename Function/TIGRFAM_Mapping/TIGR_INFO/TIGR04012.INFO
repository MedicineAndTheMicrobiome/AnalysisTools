CC  Of four genes commonly found to be involved in biosynthesis and export of poly-gamma-glutamate, pgsB(capB) and pgsC(capC) are found to be involved in the synthesis per se. Members of this family are designated PgsB, a nomeclature that covers both cases in which the poly-gamma-glutamate is secreted and those in which it is retained to form capsular material.PgsB has been shown to have poly-gamma-glutamate activity by itself but is bound tightly by PgsC (TIGR04011).
