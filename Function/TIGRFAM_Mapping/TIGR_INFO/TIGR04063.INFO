CC  PEP-CTERM/exosortase is a protein-sorting system associated with exopolysaccharide production. Members of this protein family are group 1 glycosyltransferases (see PF00534) in which the overwhelming majority occur in species with the EpsH1 form of exosortase (see TIGR03109), and usually co-clustered with the exosortase. A typical member is Daro_2409 from Dechloromonas aromatica RCB.
