CC  RuvA specifically binds Holliday junctions as a sandwich of two tetramers and maintains the configuration of the junction. It forms a complex with two hexameric rings of RuvB, the subunit that contains helicase activity. The complex drives ATP-dependent branch migration of the Holliday junction recombination intermediate. The endonuclease RuvC resolves junctions.
