CC  Malonate decarboxylase, like citrate lyase, has a unique acyl carrier protein subunit with a prosthetic group derived from, and distinct from, coenzyme A. Members of this protein family are the phosphoribosyl-dephospho-CoA transferase specific to the malonate decarboxylase system. This enzyme can also be designated holo-ACP synthase (2.7.7.61). The corresponding component of the citrate lyase system, CitX, shows little or no sequence similarity to this family.
