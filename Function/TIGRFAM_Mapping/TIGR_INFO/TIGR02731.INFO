CC  Plants and cyanobacteria (and, supposedly, Chlorobium tepidum) have a conserved pathway from two molecules geranylgeranyl-PP to one of all-trans-lycopene. Members of this family are the enzyme pytoene desaturase (also called phytoene dehydrogenase). This model does not include the region of the chloroplast transit peptide in plants. A closely related family, excluded by this model, is zeta-carotene desaturase, another enzyme in the same pathway.
