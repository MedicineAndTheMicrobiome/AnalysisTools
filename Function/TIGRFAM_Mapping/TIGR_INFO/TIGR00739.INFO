CC  While this protein is part of the preprotein translocase in Escherichia coli, it is not essential for viability or protein secretion.  The N-terminus region contains a predicted membrane-spanning region followed by a region consisting almost entirely of residues with charged (acidic, basic, or zwitterionic) side chains. This small protein is about 100 residues in length, and is restricted to bacteria; however, this protein is absent from some lineages, including spirochetes and Mycoplasmas.
