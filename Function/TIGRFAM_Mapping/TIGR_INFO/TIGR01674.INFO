EN  phage minor tail protein G
TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  This HMM describes a family of bacteriophage proteins including G of phage lambda. This protein has been described as undergoing a translational frameshift at a Gly-Lys dipeptide near the C-terminus of protein G from phage lambda, with about 4 % efficiency, to produce tail assembly protein G-T. The Lys of the Gly-Lys pair is the conserved second-to-last residue of seed alignment for this family.
DR  SP:P03734; minor tail protein G; phage lambda
RM  8230192
RT  A programmed translational frameshift is required for the synthesis of a bacteriophage lambda tail assembly protein.
