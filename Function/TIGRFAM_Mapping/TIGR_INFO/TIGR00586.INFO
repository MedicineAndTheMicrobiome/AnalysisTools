CC  All proteins in this family for which functions are known are involved in repairing oxidative damage to dGTP (they are 8-oxo-dGTPases). This family is based on the phylogenomic analysis of JA Eisen (1999, Ph.D. Thesis, Stanford University).  Lowering the threshold picks up members of MutT superfamily well.
