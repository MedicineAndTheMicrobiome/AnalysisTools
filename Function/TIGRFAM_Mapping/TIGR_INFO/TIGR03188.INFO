CC  This enzyme, phosphoribosyl-ATP pyrophosphohydrolase, catalyses the second step in the histidine biosynthesis pathway. It often occurs as a fusion protein. This model a somewhat narrower scope than Pfam model PF01503, as some paralogs that appear to be functionally distinct are excluded from this model.
