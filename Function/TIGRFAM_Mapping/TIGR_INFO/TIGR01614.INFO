CC  This HMM describes a plant domain of about 200 amino acids, characterized by four conserved Cys residues, shown in a pectinesterase inhibitor from Kiwi to form two disulfide bonds: first to second and third to fourth.  Roughly half the members of this family have the region described by this HMM followed immediately by a pectinesterase domain, PF01095. This suggests that the pairing of the enzymatic domain and its inhibitor reflects a conserved regulatory mechanism for this enzyme family.
