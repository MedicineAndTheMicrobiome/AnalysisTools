CC  This HMM describes the spoVD subfamily of homologs of the cell division protein FtsI, a penicillin binding protein. This subfamily is restricted to Bacillus subtilis and related Gram-positive species with known or suspected endospore formation capability. In these species, the functional equivalent of FtsI is desginated PBP-2B, a paralog of spoVD.
