CC  This HMM describes a tightly conserved but broadly distributed subfamily (here designated as short form) of known and putative bacterial glucose-1-phosphate thymidylyltransferases. It is well characterized in several species as the first of four enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of dTDP-L-rhamnose, a cell wall constituent and a feedback inhibitor of the enzyme.
