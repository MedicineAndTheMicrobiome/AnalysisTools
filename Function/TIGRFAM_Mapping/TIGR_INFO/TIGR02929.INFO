CC  Nitrogenase, also called dinitrogenase, is the enzyme of biological nitrogen fixation. The most wide-spread and most efficient nitrogenase contains a molybdenum cofactor. This protein family, AnfG, represents the delta subunit of the Fe-only alternative nitrogenase. It is homologous to VnfG, the delta subunit of the V-containing (vanadium) nitrogenase.
