CC  Nomenclature follows the description for Methanosarcina thermophila. The CO-methylating acetyl-CoA synthase is considered the defining enzyme of the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway, used for acetate catabolism by sulfate reducing bacteria but for acetate biosynthesis by acetogenic bacteria such as oorella thermoacetica (f. Clostridium thermoaceticum).
