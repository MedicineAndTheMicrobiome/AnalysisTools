CC  All proteins in this family for which functions are known are 3'-5' DNA-DNA helicases.  These proteins are used for recombination, recombinational repair, and possibly maintenance of chromosome stability.
CC  This family is based on the phylogenomic analysis of JA Eisen (1999, Ph.D. Thesis, Stanford University).
