CC  This HMM represents nearly the full length of MJ1255 from Methanococcus jannaschii and of an unpublished protein from Vibrio cholerae, as well as the C-terminal half of a protein from Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum. A small region (~50 amino acids) within the domain appears related to a family of sugar transferases.
