CC  Members of this family are the phage shock protein PspA, from the phage shock operon. This is a narrower family than the set of PspA and its homologs, sometimes several in a genome, as described by PFAM model PF04012. PspA appears to maintain the protonmotive force under stress conditions that include overexpression of certain phage secretins, heat shock, ethanol, and protein export defects.
