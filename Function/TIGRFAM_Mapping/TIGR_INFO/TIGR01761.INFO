CC  This reductase is found associated with gene clusters for the biosynthesis of various non-ribosomal peptide derived natural products in which cysteine is cyclized to a thiazoline ring containing an imide double bond.  Examples include yersiniabactin (irp3/YbtU, GP|21959262) and pyochelin (PchG, GP|4325022).
