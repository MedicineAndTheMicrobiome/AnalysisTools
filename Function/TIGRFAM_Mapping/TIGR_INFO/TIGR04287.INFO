CC  Members of this protein family are exosortase K, a bacterial branch of the archaeosortase/exosortase family of protein-processing enzymes (see TIGR04178). All members of the seed alignment are encoded next to a member of family TIGR04286, which has the putative processing signal MSEP-CTERM (see family TIGR04286) at the extreme C-terminus.
