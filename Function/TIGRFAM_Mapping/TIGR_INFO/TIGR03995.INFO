CC  Members of this family of small proteins, approx. 100 amino acids in length, co-occur with a subfamily of radical SAM protein in several species in the Halobacteria and in Bacillus. The radical SAM protein belongs to a branch in which most characterized members act on peptide substrates. The lack of homology of this family to any known enzyme and the distinctive C-terminal region motif, with the common modification target residue Cys flanked by sterically permissive Gly residues.
