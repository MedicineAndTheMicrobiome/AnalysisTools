CC  Members of this family are a radical SAM enzyme of post-translational modification of ribosomally translated peptides. In Bacillus subtilis, the enzyme SkfB creates a sactipeptide (sulfur-to-alpha-carbon) crosslink of Cys-4 to Met-12 of the mature form of sporulation killing factor (SkfA). In Paenibacillus larvae subsp. larvae B-3650, the Met is replaced by Leu, so the modification must be different. SkfB has 2 4Fe-4S clusters, one in its radical SAM domain (PF04055) and one in a region that somewhat resembles the SPASM domain (TIGR04085).
