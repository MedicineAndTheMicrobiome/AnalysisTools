CC  Members of this family show sequence similarity to cupin fold proteins (see PF07883), including conserved His residues likely to serve as metal-binding ligands. Many members occur in bacterial O-antigen biosynthesis regions. Some members have acquired the gene symbol wbuC (e.g. Jarvis, et al, 2011), but publications using this term do not ascribe a function.
