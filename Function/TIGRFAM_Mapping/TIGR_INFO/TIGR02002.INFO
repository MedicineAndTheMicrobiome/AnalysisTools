CC  This HMM represents the combined B and C domains of the PTS transport system enzyme II specific for glucose transport [1].  Many of the genes in this family also include an A domain as part of the same polypeptide and thus should be given the name "PTS system, glucose-specific IIABC component" while the B. subtilus enzyme also contains an enzyme III domain which appears to act independently of the enzyme II domains [2].  This family is most closely related to the N-acetylglucosamine-specific PTS enzymes (TIGR01998).
