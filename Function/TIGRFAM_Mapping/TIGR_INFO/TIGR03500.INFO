CC  This short protein found in flagellar biosynthesis operons contains a highly hydrophobic N-terminal sequence followed generally by two basic amino acids. This region is reminiscent of but distinct from the twin-arginine translocation signal sequence.  Some instances of this gene have been names "FliZ" but phylogenetic tree building supports a single FliO family.
