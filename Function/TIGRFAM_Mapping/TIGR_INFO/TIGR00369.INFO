CC  Most proteins containing this domain consist almost entirely of a single copy of this domain. A protein from C. elegans consists of two tandem copies of the domain. The domain is also found as the N-terminal region of an apparent initiation factor eIF-2B alpha subunit of Aquifex aeolicus. The function of the domain is unknown.
