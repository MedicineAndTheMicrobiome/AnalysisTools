CC  This domain is found as a leader peptide in at least two proteins targeted to the exosporium, a structure that occurs as the outermost layer of Bacillus anthracis, B. cereus, and B. thuringiensis spores. The exosporium consists of a basal layer and a nap of hair-like filaments. BclA, the major protein of the nap filaments, is targeted there by this leader peptide.
