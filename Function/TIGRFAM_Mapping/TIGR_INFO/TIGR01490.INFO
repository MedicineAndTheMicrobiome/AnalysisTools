TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  This hypothetical equivalog is a member of the IB subfamily (TIGR01488) of the haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily of aspartate-nucleophile hydrolases.  The sequences modelled by this HMM are all bacterial.
CC  The IB subfamily includes the enzyme phosphoserine phosphatase (TIGR00338).  Due to this relationship, several of these sequences have been annotated as "phosphoserine phosphatase related proteins," or "Phosphoserine phosphatase-family enzymes."  There is presently no evidence that any of the enzymes in this HMM possess PSPase activity.  OMNI|NTL01ML1250 is annotated as a "possible transferase," however this is due to the C-terminal domain found on this sequence which is homologous to a group of  glycerol-phosphate acyltransferases (between trusted and noise to TIGR00530).
CC  A subset of these sequences including OMNI|CC1962, the Caulobacter crescentus CicA protein cluster together and may represent a separate equivalog.
