CC  Members of this protein share two defining regions. One is a histidine/serine-rich cluster, typically H-R-S-H-S-S-H-R-S-H-S-S-H. Members are found always in the context of a pair of radical SAM proteins, HxsB and HxsC, and a fourth protein HxsD. The system is predicted to perform peptide modifications, likely in the His-Xaa-Ser region, to produce some uncharacterized natural product.
