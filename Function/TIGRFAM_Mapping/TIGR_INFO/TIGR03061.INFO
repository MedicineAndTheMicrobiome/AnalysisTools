CC  This family contains the N-terminal domain of a family of multiple membrane-spanning proteins of Gram-positive bacteria. One member was shown to be a host protein essential for phage infection, so many members of this family are called "phage infection protein". A separate model, TIGR03062, represents the conserved C-terminal domain. The domains are separated by regions highly variable in both length and sequence, often containing extended heptad repeats as described in model TIGR03057.
