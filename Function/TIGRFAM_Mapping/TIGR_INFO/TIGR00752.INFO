CC  Slp superfamily members are present in the Gram-negative gamma proteobacteria Escherichia coli, which also contains a close paralog, Haemophilus influenzae and Pasteurella multocida and Vibrio cholera.  The known members of the family to date share a motif LX[GA]C near the N-terminus, which is compatible with the possibility that the protein is modified into a lipoprotein with Cys as the new N-terminus. Slp from Escherichia coli is known to be a lipoprotein of the outer membrane and to be expressed in response to carbon starvation.
