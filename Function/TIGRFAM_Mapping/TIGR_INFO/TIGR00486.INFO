CC  The characterization of this family of uncharacterized proteins as orthologous is tentative. Members are found in all three domains of life. Several members (from Bacillus subtilis, Listeria monocytogenes, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis - all classified as Firmicutes within the Eubacteria) share a long insert relative to other members.
