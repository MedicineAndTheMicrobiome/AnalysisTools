CC  This HMM represents of one of several subtypes of the class II fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase, an enzyme of glycolysis. The subtypes are split into several HMMs to allow separation of a family of tagatose bisphosphate aldolases. This form is found in Gram-positive bacteria, a variety of Gram-negative, and in amitochondriate protists. The class II enzymes share homology with tagatose bisphosphate aldolase but not with class I aldolase.
