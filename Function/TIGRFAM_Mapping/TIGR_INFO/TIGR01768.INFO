CC  This model represents a family of sequences including geranylgeranylglyceryl phosphate synthase which catalyzes the first committed step in the synthesis of ether-linked membrane lipids in archaea [1].  The clade of bacterial sequences may have the same function or a closely related function. This model supercedes TIGR00265, which has been retired.
