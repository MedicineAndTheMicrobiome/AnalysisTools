CC  Bacterial PTS transporters transport and concomitantly phosphorylate their sugar substrates, and typically consist of multiple subunits or protein domains. The Fru family is a large and complex family which includes several sequenced fructose and mannitol-specific permeases as well as several  PTS components of unknown specificities. The fructose components of this family phosphorylate fructose on the 1-position. The Fru family PTS systems typically have 3 domains, IIA, IIB and IIC, which may be found as 1 or more proteins. The fructose and mannitol transporters form separate phylogenetic clusters in this family. This family is specific for the IIB domain of the fructose PTS transporters.
