CC  This HMM describes a cysteine-rich repeat found in a number of bacterial putative radical-SAM modified natural product precursors. A substantial fraction of members of this family have been missed during gene-finding. A true hit to the model must exceed both TC on the whole and trusted cutoff 2 for at least one domain, to avoid false-positives from African swine fever virus proteins.
