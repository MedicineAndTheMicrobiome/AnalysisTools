CC  This subfamily includes two enzymes which are variants on the mechanism of chorismate mutase and are likely to have evolved from an ancestral chorismate mutase enzyme.  4-amino-4-deoxy-chorismate mutase produces amino-deoxy-prephenate which is subsequently converted to para-dimethylamino-phenylalanine, a component of the natural product pristinamycin [1].  Isochorismate-pyruvate lyase presumably catalyzes the same type of 2+2+2 cyclo-rearrangement as chorismate mutase, but acting on isochorismate, this results in two broken bonds instead of one broken and one made.  The product of this reaction is salicylate (2-hydroxy-benzoate) which is also incorporated into various natural products [2].
