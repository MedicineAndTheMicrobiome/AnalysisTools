CC  Members of this protein family are small peptides found in the vicinity of a peptide modification-type radical SAM protein family. Multiple members of this protein family occur in species with a selenocysteine incorporation systems and have a TGA stop codon at position that aligns with cysteine residues from other homologs. This finding strongly suggests that GSU_1558 and similar members of the family are selenopeptides. The selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS) finder bSECISearch finds two homologous SECIS elements for two TGA codons in the extension of GSU_1558. Meanwhile, the pairing with the radical SAM enzyme suggests additional modification.
