CC  This model describes the ATP synthase delta subunit in bacteria,  mitochondria, and chloroplasts.  It is sometimes called OSCP for Oligomycin Sensitivity Conferring Protein. F1/F0-ATP synthase is a multisubunit, membrane associated enzyme found in bacteria and organelles of higher eukaryotes, namely, mitochondria and chloroplast. This enzyme is principally involved in the synthesis of ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate by coupling the energy derived from the proton electrochemical gradient across the biological membrane. A brief description of this multisubunit enzyme complex: F1 and F0 represent two major clusters of subunits. Delta subunit belongs to the F1 cluster or sector and functionally implicated in the overall stability of the complex. Expression of truncated forms of this subunit results in low ATPase activity.
