CC  This model describes ExbB proteins, part of the MotA/TolQ/ExbB protein family. The paired proteins MotA and MotB, TolQ and TolR, and ExbB and ExbD harness the proton-motive force to drive the flagellar motor, energize the Tol-Pal system, or energize TonB, respectively. Tol-Pal and TonB are both active at the outer membrane. Genomes may have many different TonB-dependent receptors, of which many of those characterized are involved in siderophore transport across the outer membrane.
