CC  This enzyme catalyzes the second step in the degradation of 4-hydroxyphenylacetate to succinate and pyruvate. 4-hydroxyphenylacetate arises from the degradation of tyrosine.  The substrate, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetate (homoprotocatechuate) arises from the action of a hydroxylase on 4-hydroxyphenylacetate.  The aromatic ring is opened by this dioxygenase exo to the 3,4-diol resulting in 2-hydroxy-5-carboxymethylmuconate semialdehyde.
CC  The enzyme from Bacillus brevis contains manganese [1].
