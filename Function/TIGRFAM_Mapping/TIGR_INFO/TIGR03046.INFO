CC  Members of this protein family are PsbV2, a protein closely related cytochrome c-550 (PsbV), a protein important to the water-splitting and oxygen-evolving activity of photosystem II. Mutant studies in Thermosynechococcus elongatus showed PsbV2 can partially replace PsbV, from which it appears to have arisen first by duplication, then by intergenic recombination with a different gene.
