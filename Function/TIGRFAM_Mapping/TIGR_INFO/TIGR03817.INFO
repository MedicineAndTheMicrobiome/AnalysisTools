TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  A conserved gene neighborhood widely spread in the Actinobacteria contains this uncharacterized DEAH-box family helicase encoded convergently towards an operon of genes for protein homologous to type II secretion and pilus formation proteins. The context suggests that this helicase may play a role in conjugal transfer of DNA.
