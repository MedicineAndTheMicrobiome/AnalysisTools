CC  The Divalent Anion:Na+ Symporter (DASS) Family (TC 2.A.47)
CC  Functionally characterized proteins of the DASS family transport (1) organic di- and tricarboxylates of the Krebs Cycle as well as dicarboxylate amino acid, (2) inorganic sulfate and (3) phosphate. The animal NaDC-1 cotransport 3 Na+ with each dicarboxylate. Protonated tricarboxylates are also cotransported with 3Na+.
