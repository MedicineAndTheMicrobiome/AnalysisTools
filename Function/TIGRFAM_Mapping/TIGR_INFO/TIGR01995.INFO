CC  This HMM represents a family of PTS enzyme II proteins in which all three domains are found in the same polypeptide chain and which appear to have a broad specificity for beta-glucosides including salicin (beta-D-glucose-1-salicylate) and arbutin (Hydroquinone-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside) [1].  These are distinct from the closely related sucrose-specific and trehalose-specific PTS transporters.
