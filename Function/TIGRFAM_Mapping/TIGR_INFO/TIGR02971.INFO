CC  Members of this protein family are found mostly in the Cyanobacteria, but also in the Planctomycetes. DevB from Anabaena sp. strain PCC 7120 is partially characterized as a membrane fusion protein of the DevBCA ABC exporter, probably a glycolipid exporter, required for heterocyst formation. Most Cyanobacteria have one member only, but Nostoc sp. PCC 7120 has seven members.
