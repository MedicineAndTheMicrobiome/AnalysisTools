CC  Members of this family are ATPases that energize transport, although with different partner proteins for different functions. Recent findings show that TRC40 (GET3 in yeast) in involved in the insertion of tail-anchored membrane proteins in eukaryotes. A similar function is expected for members of this family in archaea. However, the earliest discovery of a function for this protein family is ArsA, an arsenic resistance protein that partners with ArsB (see PF02040) for As(III) efflux.
