CC  Members of this family tend to be found in O-antigen biosynthesis regions. Members frequently are misidentified as the closely related 3-dehydroquinate synthase, AroB (see family TIGR01357), the phospholyase that converts 3-deoxy-D-arabino-hept-2-ulosonate 7-phosphate to 3-dehydroquinate  during chorismate biosynthesis. Most bacteria with this enzyme have a true AroB in a chorismate biosynthesis gene cluster.
