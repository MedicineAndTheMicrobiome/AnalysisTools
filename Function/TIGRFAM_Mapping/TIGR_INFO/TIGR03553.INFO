CC  Coenzyme F420 differs between the Archaea and the Actinobacteria, where the numbers of glutamate residues attached are 2 (Archaea) or 5-6 (Mycobacterium). The enzyme in the Archaea is homologous to the N-terminal domain of FbiB from Mycobacterium bovis, and is responsible for glutamate ligation. Therefore it seems likely that the C-terminal domain of FbiB, modeled by this HMM, is involved in additional glutamate ligation.
