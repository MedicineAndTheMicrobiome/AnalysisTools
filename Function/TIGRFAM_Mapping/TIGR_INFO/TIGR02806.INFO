CC  Clostripain is a cysteine protease characterized from Clostridium histolyticum, and also known from Clostridium perfringens. It is a heterodimer processed from a single precursor polypeptide, specific for Arg-|-Xaa peptide bonds. The older term alpha-clostripain refers to the most active, most reduced form, rather than to the product of one of several different genes. Clostripain belongs to the peptidase family C11, or clostripain family (see PF03415).
