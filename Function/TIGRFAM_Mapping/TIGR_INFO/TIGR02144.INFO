CC  The family of proteins found in this equivalog include the characterized LysX from Thermus thermophilus [1] which is part of a well-organized lysine biosynthesis gene cluster [2].  LysX is believed to carry out an ATP-dependent acylation of the amino group of alpha-aminoadipate in the prokaryotic version of the fungal AAA lysine biosynthesis pathway.  No species having a sequence in this equivalog contains the elements of the more common diaminopimelate lysine biosythesis pathway, and none has been shown to be a lysine auxotroph.  These sequences have mainly recieved the name of the related enzyme, "ribosomal protein S6 modification protein RimK".  RimK has been characterized in E. coli, and acts by ATP-dependent condensation of S6 with glutamate residues [3].
