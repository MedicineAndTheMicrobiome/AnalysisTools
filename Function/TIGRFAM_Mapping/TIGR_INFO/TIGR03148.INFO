CC  Members of this protein family are NrfD, a highly hydrophobic protein encoded in the nrf operon, which encodes cytochrome c nitrite reductase. This multiple heme-containing enzyme can reduce nitrite to ammonia. Members belong to a broader PFAM protein family, PF03916, which also contains an NrfD-related subunit of polysulphide reductase.
