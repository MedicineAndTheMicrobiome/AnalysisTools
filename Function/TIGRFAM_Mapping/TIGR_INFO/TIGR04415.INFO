CC  This model describes two tandem copies of a strand-loop-strand repeat that occurs often in type V secretion system (T5SS). These repeats usually occur in the passenger domain of the classical monomeric autotransporter. Proteins with this repeat often are encoded next to a member of family TIGR04414, the Aah/TibC family O-heptosyltransferase, and may be glycosylated in regions with this repeat.
