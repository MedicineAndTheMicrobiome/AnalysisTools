CC  Members of this protein family, to date, are found in a completed prokaryotic genome if and only if the species is one of the archaeal methanogens. The exact function is unknown, but likely is linked to methanogenesis or a process closely connected to it. This protein is a predicted to bind FeS clusters, based on the presence of two copies of the Fer4 domain (PF00037), with each copy having four Cys residues invariant across all members.
