CC  This model represents a family of bacterial and metazoan purine phosphorylases acting primarily on inosine and guanosine and not acting on adenosine.  
CC  PNP-I refers to the nomenclature from Bacillus stearothermophilus [1] where PHP-II refers to the nucleotidase acting on adenosine as the primary substrate.
CC  The bacterial enzymes (PUNA) are typified by the Bacilus PupG protein [2] which is involved in the metabolism of nucleosides as a carbon source.
CC  Several metazoan enzymes (PNPH) are well characterized including the human [3] and bovine [4] enzymes which have been crystallized.
