CC  The six subunit complex RnfABCDGE in Rhodobacter capsulatus encodes an apparent NADH oxidoreductase responsible for electron transport to nitrogenase, necessary for nitrogen fixation. A closely related complex in E. coli, RsxABCDGE (Reducer of SoxR), reduces the 2Fe-2S-containing superoxide sensor SoxR, active as a transcription factor when oxidized. This family of putative NADH oxidoreductase complexes exists in many of the same species as the related NQR, a Na(+)-translocating NADH-quinone reductase, but is distinct. This model describes the A subunit.
