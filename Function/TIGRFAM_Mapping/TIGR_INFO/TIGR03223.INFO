CC  This family of proteins is observed in the vicinity of other caharacterized genes involved in the catabolism of phosphonates via the3 C-P lyase system (GenProp0232), its function is unknown.  These proteins are members of the somewhat broader PF06299 model "Protein of unknown function (DUF1045)" which contains proteins found in a different genomic context as well.
