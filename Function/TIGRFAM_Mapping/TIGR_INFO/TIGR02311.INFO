CC  This model represents the aldolase which performs the final step unique to the 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid catabolism pathway in which 2,4-dihydroxyhept-2-ene-1,7-dioic acid is split into pyruvate and succinate-semialdehyde.  The gene for enzyme is generally found adjacent to other genes for this pathway organized into an operon.
