CC  Members of this protein family are the IcmQ component of Dot/Icm secretion systems, as found in obligate intracellular pathogens Legionella pneumophila and Coxiella burnetii. While this system resembles type IV secretion systems and has been called a form of type IV, the literature now seems to favor calling this the Dot/Icm system. This protein was shown to be essential for translocation (PMID:15661013).
