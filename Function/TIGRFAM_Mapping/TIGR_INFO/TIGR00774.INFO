CC  These proteins are members of the NhaB Na+:H+ Antiporter (NhaB) Family (TC 2.A.34).  The only characterised member of this family is the Escherichia coli NhaB protein, which has 12 GES predicted transmembrane regions, and catalyses sodium/proton exchange. Unlike NhaA this activity is not pH dependent.
