CC  Members of this family occur as paralogs in species capable of generating methane from mono-, di-, and tri-methylamine. Members include RamA (Reductive Activation of Methyltransfer, Amines) from Methanosarcina barkeri MS (DSM 800). Member proteins have two C-terminal motifs with four Cys each, likely to bind one 4Fe-4S cluster per motif.
