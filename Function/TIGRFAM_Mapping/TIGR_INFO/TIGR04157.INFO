CC  Members of this protein family are predicted glycosyltransferases that occur in conserved gene neighborhoods in various members of the Bacteroidales. These neighborhoods feature a radical SAM enzyme predicted to act in peptide modification (family TIGR04148), peptides from family TIGR04149 with a characteristic GG cleavage motif, and several other proteins.
