CC  Members of this protein family are found exclusively in Firmicutes (low-GC Gram-positive bacterial) and are known from studies in Bacillus subtilis to be part of the sigma-E regulon. Mutation leads to a sporulation defect, confirming that members of this protein family, YlbJ, are sporulation proteins. This protein appears to be universal among endospore-forming bacteria, but is encoded by a pair ORFs distant from eash other in Symbiobacterium thermophilum IAM14863.
