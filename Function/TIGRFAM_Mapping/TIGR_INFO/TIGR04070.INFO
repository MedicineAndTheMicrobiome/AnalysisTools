CC  DNA damage to bacterial spores from ultraviolet light accumulates in the form of 5-thyminyl-5,6-dihydrothymine, spore photoproduct. The damage is repaired by spore photoproduct lyase, a member of the radical SAM family of enzymes. The score of this model is set to restrict itself to spore-forming members of the Firmicutes, but additional homologs scoring below the trusted cutoff tend to occur in radioresistant organisms (e.g. Kineococcus radiotolerans) and may be functionally equivalent.  A related family in the Mycobacterium lineage is described by family TIGR03886, and may or may not be equivalent in function.
