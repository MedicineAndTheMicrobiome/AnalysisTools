CC  This hypothetical protein is found so far only in the Archaea. Its C-terminal domain of about 40 amino acids is homologous to the C-termini of the nascent polypeptide-associated complex alpha chain (alpha-NAC) and its yeast ortholog Egd2p and to the huntingtin-interacting protein HYPK. It shows weaker similarity, possibly through shared structural constraints rather than through homology, with the amino-terminal domain of elongation factor Ts. Alpha-NAC plays a role in preventing nascent polypeptides from binding inappropriately to membrane-targeting apparatus during translation, but is also active as a transcription regulator.
