CC  All members of the seed alignment for this model are translated from the iolC gene of known or putative inositol catabolism operons. Members with characterized function are 5-dehydro-2-deoxygluconokinase, the enzyme catalyzing the fifth step in degradation from myo-inositol or closely related compounds. Note that many members of this family are fusion proteins with an additional C-terminal domain, of unknown function, described by Pfam model PF09863.
