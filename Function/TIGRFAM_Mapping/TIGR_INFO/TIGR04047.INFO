CC  A conserved gene cluster found sporadically from Actinobacteria to Proteobacteria to Cyanobacteria features a radical SAM protein, an N-acetyltransferase, an oxidoreductase, and two additional proteins whose functional classes are unclear. The metabolic role of the cluster is probably biosynthetic. This glycosyltransferase, named from member MSMEG_0565 from Mycobacterium smegmatis, occurs in most but not all instances of the cluster.
