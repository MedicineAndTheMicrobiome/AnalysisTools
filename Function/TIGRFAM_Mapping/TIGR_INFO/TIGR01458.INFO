CC  This hypothetical equivalog is a member of the IIA subfamily (TIGR01460) of the haloacid dehalogenase superfamily of aspartate-nucleophile hydrolases. One sequence (GP|10716807) has been annotated as a "phospholysine phosphohistidine inorganic pyrophosphatase," probably in reference to studies on similarly described (but unsequenced) enzymes from bovine and rat tissues [1,2].  However, the supporting information for this annotation has never been published.
