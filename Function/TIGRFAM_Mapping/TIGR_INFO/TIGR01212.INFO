EN  radical SAM protein, TIGR01212 family
TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  Members of this family are apparent radical-SAM enzymes, related to the N-terminal region of the bifunctional ELP3, whose C-terminal region is part of the elongator complex and appears to acetylate histones and other proteins. ELP3 binds S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and was recently shown to be involved in a DNA demethylation process in eukaryotes. Close sequence similarity of this family (with lacks the GNAT family acetyltransferase domain) to the ELP3 N-terminal region and a strong match to the Pfam model PF04055 support identification of this family as radical SAM despite the atypical spacing between first and second Cys residues in the 4Fe4S-binding motif.
