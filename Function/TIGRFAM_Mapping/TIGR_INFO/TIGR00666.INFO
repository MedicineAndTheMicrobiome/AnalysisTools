CC  In E. coli, this protein is known as penicillin binding protein 4 (dacB). A signal sequence is cleaved from a precursor form. The protein is described as periplasmic in E. coli (Gram-negative) and extracellular in Actinomadura R39 (Gram-positive). Unlike some other proteins with similar activity, it does not form transpeptidation. It is not essential for viability. This family is related to class A beta-lactamases.
