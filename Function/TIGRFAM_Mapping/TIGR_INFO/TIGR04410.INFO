CC  Members of this family occur only in spirochetes (Leptospira, Leptonema, Turneriella), as part of a type II secretion system (T2SS) cassette. Properly extended gene models always include an N-terminal signal sequence ending with a Cys residue, suggesting this small protein (about 100 amino acids) is a lipoprotein.
