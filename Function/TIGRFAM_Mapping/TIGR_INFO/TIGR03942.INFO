CC  Members of this protein family are radical SAM family enzymes, maturases that prepare the oxygen-sensitive radical required in the active site of anaerobic sulfatases. This maturase role has led to many misleading legacy annotations suggesting that this enzyme maturase is instead a sulfatase regulatory protein. All members of the seed alignment are radical SAM enzymes encoded next to or near an anaerobic sulfatase. Note that a single genome may encode more than one sulfatase/maturase pair.
