CC  The glycine cleavage system T protein (GcvT) is also known as aminomethyltransferase (EC 2.1.2.10). It works with the H protein (GcvH), the P protein (GcvP), and lipoamide dehydrogenase.
CC  The reported sequence of the member from Aquifex aeolicus starts about 50 residues downstream of the start of other members of the family (perhaps in error); it scores below the trusted cutoff.
CC  Eukaryotic forms are mitochondrial and have an N-terminal transit peptide.
