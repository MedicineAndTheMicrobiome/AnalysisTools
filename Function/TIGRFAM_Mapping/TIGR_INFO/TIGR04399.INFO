EN  accessory Sec system S-layer assembly protein
TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  Members of this family, designated S-layer assembly protein (SlaP), occur next to a Bacillus anthracis-type accessory Sec system SecA2. . Members have two tandem copies of a duplicated domain (TIGR04398) that may also occur in other contexts. SlaP is found both free in the cytoplasm and membrane-associated. SecA2 and SlaP appear to work together to modify Sec for efficient S-layer secretion.
