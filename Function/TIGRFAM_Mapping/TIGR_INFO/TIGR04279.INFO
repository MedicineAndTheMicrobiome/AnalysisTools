EN  TIGR04279 methanogen extracellular domain
TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  This domain, with length just over 300 amino acids, occurs in predicted extracellular proteins in a number of methanogens, in one to three proteins per genome. The aromatic residue tyrosine, comprising about five percent of the amino acid composition, is overrepresented among the most highly conserved columns of the multiple sequence alignment. The three members of this family in Methanosarcina barkeri occur all within a six-gene region.
