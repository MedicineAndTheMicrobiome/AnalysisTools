CC  This model represents the TatC translocase component of the Sec-independent protein translocation system.  This system is responsible for translocation of folded proteins, often with bound cofactors across the periplasmic membrane [1].  A related model (TIGR00945) represents the bacterial clade of this family.  TatC is often found (in bacteria) in a gene cluster with the two other components of the system, TatA/E (TIGR01411) and TatB (TIGR01410).  A model also exists for the Twin-arginine signal sequence (TIGR01409).
