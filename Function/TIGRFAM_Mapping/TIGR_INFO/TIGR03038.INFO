CC  Members of this protein family are the photosystem II reaction center M protein, product of the psbM gene, in Cyanobacteria and their derived organelles in plants. This model resembles Pfam model PF05151 but has cutoffs set to avoid false-positive matches to similar (not necessarily homologous) sequences in species that are not photosynthetic.
