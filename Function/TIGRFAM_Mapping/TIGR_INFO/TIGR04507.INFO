CC  Members of this family are fluorinase (adenosyl-fluoride synthase, EC 2.5.1.63), an enzyme involved in the first committed step in the biosynthesis of at least two different organofluorine compounds. Few organofluorine natural products are known. Related enzymes include chlorinases (EC 2.5.1.94) that lack fluorinase activity, although a fluorinase may show chlorinase activity.
