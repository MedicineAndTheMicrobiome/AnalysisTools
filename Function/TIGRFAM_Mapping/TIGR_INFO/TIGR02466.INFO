CC  This family consists of uncharacterized proteins in Caulobacter crescentus CB15, Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus HD100, Synechococcus sp. WH 8102 (2), Silicibacter pomeroyi DSS-3 (2), and  Hyphomonas neptunium ATCC 15444. The context of nearby genes differs substantially between members and does point to any specific biological role.
