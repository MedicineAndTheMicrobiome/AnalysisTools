CC  Tryptophan synthase catalyzes the last step in the biosynthesis of tryptophan. The alpha chain is responsible for the aldol cleavage of indoleglycerol phosphate to indole and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. In  bacteria  and  plants each domain is found on a separate subunit (alpha and beta chains),  while  in fungi the two domains are fused together on a single multifunctional protein. The signature pattern for trpA contains three conserved acidic residues. [LIVM]-E-[LIVM]-G-x(2)-[FYC]-[ST]-[DE]-[PA]-[LIVMY]-[AGLI]-[DE]-G and this is located between residues 43-58 of the model. The Sulfolobus solfataricus trpA is known to be quite divergent from other known trpA sequences.
