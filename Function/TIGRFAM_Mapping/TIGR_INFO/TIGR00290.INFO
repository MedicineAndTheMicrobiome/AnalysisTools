CC  Proteins with this uncharacterized domain include two apparent ortholog families in the Archaea, one of which is universal among the first four completed archaeal genomes, and YLR143W, a much longer protein from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The domain comprises the full length of the archaeal proteins and the first third of the yeast protein.
