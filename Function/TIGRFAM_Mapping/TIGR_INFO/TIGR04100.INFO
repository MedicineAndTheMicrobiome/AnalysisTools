CC  Members of this protein family are radical SAM enzymes that appear paired with members of TIGR04002, a family of small (~170 residue), mostly hydrophobic  protein. This family of radical SAM enzymes belongs to a larger family TIGR04038, in which some members show regularly in contexts with TatD.
