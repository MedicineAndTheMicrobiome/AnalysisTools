CC  This conserved hypothetical protein is found so far only in three archaeal genomes and in Streptomyces coelicolor. It shares a hydrophobic uncharacterized domain (see HMM TIGR00271) of about 180 residues with several eubacterial proteins, including the much longer protein sll1151 of Synechocystis PCC6803.
