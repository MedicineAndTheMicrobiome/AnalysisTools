CC  The MTC family consists of a limited number of homologues, all from eukaryotes. A single member of the family has been functionally characterized, the tricarboxylate carrier from rat liver mitochondria. The rat liver mitochondrial tricarboxylate carrier has been reported to transport citrate, cis-aconitate, threo-D-isocitrate, D- and L-tartrate, malate, succinate and phosphoenolpyruvate. It presumably functions by a proton symport mechanism.
