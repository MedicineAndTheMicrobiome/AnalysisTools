CC  The member of this family from Pyrococcus horikoshii has been solved to 2 Angstrom resolution. It is an ATP-independent intracellular protease that crystallizes as a hexameric ring. Cys-101 is proposed as the active site residue in a catalytic triad with the adjacent His-102 and a Glu residue from an adjacent monomer. A member of this family from Bacillus subtilis, GSP18, has been shown to be expressed in response to several forms of stress. A role in the degradation of small peptides has been suggested. A closely related family consists of the thiamine biosynthesis protein ThiJ and its homologs.
