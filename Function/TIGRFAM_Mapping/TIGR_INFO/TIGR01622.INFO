CC  This model represents a subfamily of RNA splicing factors including the Pad-1 protein (N. crassa), CAPER (M. musculus) and CC1.3 (H.sapiens).  These proteins are characterized by  an N-terminal arginine-rich, low complexity domain followed by three (or in the case of 4 H. sapiens paralogs, two) RNA recognition domains (rrm: PF00706).  These splicing factors are closely related to the U2AF splicing factor family (TIGR01642).
CC  A homologous gene from Plasmodium falciparum was identified in the course of the analysis of that genome at TIGR [4] and was included in the seed.
