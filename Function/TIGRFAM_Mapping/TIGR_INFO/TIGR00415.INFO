CC  The seryl-tRNA synthetases from a few of the Archaea, represented by this model, are very different from the set of mutually more closely related seryl-tRNA synthetases from Eubacteria, Eukaryotes, and other Archaea. Although distantly homologous, the present set differs enough not to be recognized by the pfam HMM tRNA-synt_2b that recognizes the remainder of seryl-tRNA synthetases among oither class II amino-acyl tRNA synthetases.
