CC  This model represents archaeal examples of the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase (NADP) (EC 1.1.1.34) and the catalytic domain of eukaryotic examples, which also contain a hydrophobic N-terminal domain. This enzyme synthesizes mevalonate, a precursor of isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP), a building block for the synthesis of cholesterol, isoprenoids, and other molecules. A related hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase, typified by an example from Pseudomonas mevalonii, is NAD-dependent and catabolic.
