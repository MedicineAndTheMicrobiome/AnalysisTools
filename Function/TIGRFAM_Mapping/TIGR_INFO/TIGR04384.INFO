CC  Members of this family are putrescine carbamoyltransferase (EC 2.1.3.6). There is some overlapping specificity with ornithine carbamoyltransferase (EC 2.1.3.3). The gene regularly is found next to agmatine deiminase and a carbamate kinase, suggesting a conserved catabolic agmatine deiminase pathway.
