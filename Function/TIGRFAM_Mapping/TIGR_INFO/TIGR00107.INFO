CC  Purine nucleoside phosphorylase (also called inosine phosphorylase) is a purine salvage enzyme. Purine nucleosides, such as guanosine, inosine, or xanthosine, plus orthophosphate, can be converted to their respective purine bases (guanine, hypoxanthine, or xanthine) plus ribose-1-phosphate. This family of purine nucleoside phosphorylase is restricted to the bacteria.
