CC  This enzyme catalyzes the cyclo-ligation of 3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone-4-P and 5-amino-6-ribitylamino-2,4(1H,3H)-pyrimidinedione to form 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine, the immediate precursor of riboflavin.  Sometimes referred to as riboflavin synthase, beta subunit, this should not be confused with the alpha subunit which carries out the subsequent reaction.
CC  Archaeal members of this family are considered putative, although included in the seed and scoring above the trusted cutoff.
