CC  This HMM describes pantetheine-phosphate adenylyltransferase, the penultimate enzyme of coenzyme A (CoA) biosynthesis in bacteria. It does not show any strong homology to eukaryotic enzymes of coenzyme A biosynthesis. This protein was previously designated KdtB and postulated (because of cytidyltransferase homology and proximity to kdtA) to be an enzyme of LPS biosynthesis, a cytidyltransferase for 3-deoxy-D-manno-2-octulosonic acid. However, no activity toward that compound was found with either CTP or ATP. The phylogenetic distribution of this enzyme is more consistent with coenzyme A biosynthesis than with LPS biosynthesis.
