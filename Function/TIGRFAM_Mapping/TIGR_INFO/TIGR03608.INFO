EN  putative bacteriocin export ABC transporter, lactococcin 972 group
TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  A gene pair with a fairly wide distribution consists of a polypeptide related to the lactococcin 972 (see TIGR01653) and multiple-membrane-spanning putative immunity protein (see TIGR01654). This model represents a small clade within the ABC transporters that regularly are found adjacent to these bacteriocin system gene pairs and are likely serve as export proteins.
