CC  This CoA-binding enzyme is required for the production of pimeloyl-coenzyme A, the substrate of the BioF protein early in the biosynthesis of biotin. Its exact function is unknown, but is proposed in ref 2. This enzyme belongs to the alpha/beta hydrolase fold family (Pfam HMM PF00561). Members of this family are restricted to the Proteobacteria.
