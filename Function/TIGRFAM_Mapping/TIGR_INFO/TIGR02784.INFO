CC  AddAB, also called RexAB, substitutes for RecBCD in several bacterial lineages. These DNA recombination proteins act before synapse and are particularly important for DNA repair  of double-stranded breaks by homologous recombination. The term AddAB is used broadly, with AddA homologous between the alphaproteobacteria (as modeled here) and the  Firmicutes, while the partner AddB proteins show no strong homology across the two groups of species.
