CC  This 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase is involved in the degradation of phenylacetic acid, presumably in steps following the opening of the phenyl ring [1].  The sequences included in this model are all found in aparrent operons with other related genes such as paaA, paaB, paaD, paaE, paaF and paaN [2].  Some genomes contain these other genes without an apparent paaC in the same operon - possibly in these cases a different dehydrogenase involved in fatty acid degradation may fill in the needed activity.  This enzyme has domains which are members of the PF02737 and PF00725 families.
