CC  This model represents a set of probable methyltransferases, about 300 amino acids long, with essentially full length homology. Members share an N-terminal region described by Pfam model PF02409. Included are a paralogous family of 12 proteins in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, plus close homologs in related species, a family of 8 in the archaeon Methanosarcina acetivorans, and small numbers of members in other species, including plants.
