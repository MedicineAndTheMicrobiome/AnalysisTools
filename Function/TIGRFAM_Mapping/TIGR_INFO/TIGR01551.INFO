EN  phage major capsid protein, P2 family
TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  This HMM family represents the major capsid protein component of the heads (capsids) of bacteriophage P2 and related phage.  This model represents one of several analogous families lacking detectable sequence similarity.  The gene encoding this component is typically located in an operon encoding the small and large terminase subunits, the portal protein and the prohead or maturation protease.
