CC  Members of this protein family are the iron-sulfur cluster (FeS) metabolism protein CyaY, a homolog of eukaryotic frataxin. ISC is one of several bacterial systems for FeS assembly; we find by Partial Phylogenetic Profiling vs. the ISC system that CyaY most like work with the ISC system for FeS cluster biosynthesis. A study of of cyaY mutants in Salmonella enterica bears this out. Although the trusted cutoff is set low enough to include eukaryotic frataxin sequences, a narrower, exception-type model (TIGR03421) identifies identifies members of that specific set.
