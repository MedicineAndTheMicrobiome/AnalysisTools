CC  Members of this family are highly hydrophobic bacterial proteins of about 90 amino acids in length. Members usually are found immediately upstream (sometimes fused to) a member of the  solute:sodium symporter family, and therefore are a putative sodium:solute symporter small subunit. Members tend to be found in aquatic species, especially those from marine or other high salt environments.
