TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  Members of this small family are putative RiPP (Ribosomally translated, Post-translationally modified Peptides) precursors, modified by RimK-like ATP-grasp proteins. Members are encoded near both an ATP-grasp protein and C39 peptidase domain-containing transporter. Members are short polypeptides that contain the GG motif expected for cleavage on export.
