CC  Members of this protein family are the precursors of a family of small bacteriocins (i.e. microcins) with thiopeptide type modifications, a highly modified subclass of heterocycle-containing peptide antibiotics. Members tend to be found clustered in genomes with proteins recognized by TIGR03891 and proteins/domains annotated as lantibiotic dehydratase (PF04737, PF04738), and with a cyclodehydratase/docking protein fusion protein characteristic of heterocycle formation. The seed alignment includes both an N-terminal leader peptide region and a C-terminal low-complexity region consisting mostly of Cys and Ser residues. Members with known function block translation by inhibiting translation factor activity.
