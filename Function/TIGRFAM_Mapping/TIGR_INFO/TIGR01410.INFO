CC  This HMM represents the TatB protein of a Sec-independent system for transporting folded proteins, often with a bound redox cofactor, across the bacterial inner membrane. TatC is the multiple membrane spanning component. TatB, like the related TatA/E proteins, appears to span the membrane one time. The tat system recognizes proteins with an elongated signal sequence containing a conserved R-R in a motif approximated by RRxFLK N-terminal to the transmembrane helix. TIGRFAMs model TIGR01409 describes this twin-Arg signal sequence. A similar system, termed Delta-pH-dependent transport, operates on chloroplast-encoded proteins.
