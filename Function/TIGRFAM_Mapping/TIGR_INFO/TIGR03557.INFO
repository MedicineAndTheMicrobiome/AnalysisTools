CC  Members of this protein family include F420-dependent glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenases (TIGR03554) and related proteins. All members of this family come from species that synthesize coenzyme F420, with the exception of those that belong to TIGR03885, a clade within this family in which cofactor binding may instead be directed to FMN.
