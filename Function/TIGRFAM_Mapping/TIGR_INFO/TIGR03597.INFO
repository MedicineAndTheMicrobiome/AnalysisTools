CC  This family describes YqeH, a member of a larger family of GTPases involved in ribosome biogenesis. Like YqlF, it shows a cyclical permutation relative to GTPases EngA (in which the GTPase domain is duplicated), Era, and others. Members of this protein family are found in a relatively small number of bacterial species, including Bacillus subtilis but not Escherichia coli.
