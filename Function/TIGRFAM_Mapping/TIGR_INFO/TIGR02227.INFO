CC  This HMM represents signal peptidase I from most bacteria. Eukaryotic sequences are likely organellar. Several bacteria have multiple paralogs, but these represent isozymes of signal peptidase I. Virtually all known bacteria may be presumed to 
CC  A related model finds a simlar protein in many archaea and a few bacteria, as well as a microsomal (endoplasmic reticulum) protein in eukaryotes.
