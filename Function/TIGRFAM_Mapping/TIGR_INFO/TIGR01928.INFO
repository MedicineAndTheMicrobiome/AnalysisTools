CC  This model describes the enzyme o-succinylbenzoic acid synthetase (menC) that is involved in one of the steps of the menaquinone biosynthesis pathway.  It takes SHCHC and makes it into 2-succinylbenzoate.  Included in this model are low GC gram positive bacteria and archaea.  Also included in the seed and in the model are enzymes with the com-name of N-acylamino acid racemase (or the more general term, racemase / racemase family), which refers to the enzyme's industrial application as racemases, and not to its biological function as o-succinylbenzoic acid synthetase.
