CC  This family of mainly alphaproteobacterial enzymes is a member of the isocitrate/isopropylmalate dehydrogenase superfamily described by PF00180.  Every member of the seed of this model appears to have a TCA cycle lacking only a determined isocitrate dehydrogenase.  The precise identity of the cofactor (NADH -- 1.1.1.41 vs. NADPH -- 1.1.1.42) is unclear.
