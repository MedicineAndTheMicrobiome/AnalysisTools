CC  Most members of this family are pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, E1 component. Note: this family was classified as subfamily rather than equivalog because it includes a counterexample from Pseudomonas putida, MdeB, that is active as an E1 component of an alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex rather than a pyruvate dehydrogase complex. The second pyruvate dehydrogenase complex E1 protein from Alcaligenes eutrophus, PdhE, complements an aceE mutant of E. coli but is not part of a pyruvate dehydrogenase complex operon, is more similar to the Pseudomonas putida MdeB than to E. coli AceE, and may have also have a different primary specificity.
