CC  Members of this include two chemically distinct enzymes that cleave pyruvate from chorismate. FkbO and RapK convert chorismate to pyruvate plus (4R,5R)-4,5-dihydroxycyclohexa-1,5-dienecarboxylic acid (DCDC). HygB and Bra8 convert chorismate to pyruvate, water, and 3-hydroxybenzoate. These two enzymes are closely related, and lack homology to chorismate lyase, EC 4.1.3.40, which converts chorismate to pyruvate plus 4-hydroxybenzoate.
