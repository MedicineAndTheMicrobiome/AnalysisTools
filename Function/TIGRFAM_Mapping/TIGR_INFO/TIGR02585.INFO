CC  CRISPR is a term for Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palidromic Repeats. A number of protein families appear only in association with these repeats and are designated Cas (CRISPR associated) proteins.  This clade is a member of the DevR family (TIGR01875) and includes the DevR protein of Myxococcus xanthus, a protein whose expression appears to be regulated through a number of means, including both location and autorepression; DevR mutants are incapable of fruiting body development [1].
