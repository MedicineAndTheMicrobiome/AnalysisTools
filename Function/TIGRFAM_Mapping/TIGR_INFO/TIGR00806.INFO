CC  The Reduced Folate Carrier (RFC) Family (TC 2.A.48)
CC  Members of the RFC family mediate the uptake of folate, reduce
CC  folate, derivatives of reduced folate and the drug, methotrexate.
CC  Proteins of the RFC family are so-far restricted to animals.  RFC proteins  possess 12 putative transmembrane a-helical spanners (TMSs) and evidence for a 12 TMS topology has been published for the human RFC. The RFC transporters appear to transport reduced folate by an energy-dependent, pH-dependent, Na+-independent mechanism. Folate:H+ symport, folate:OH- antiport and folate:anion antiport mechanisms have been proposed, but the energetic mechanism is not well defined.
