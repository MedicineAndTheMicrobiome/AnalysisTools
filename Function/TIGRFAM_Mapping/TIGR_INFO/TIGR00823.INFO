CC  The PTS Lactose-N,N?-Diacetylchitobiose-b-glucoside (Lac) Family (TC 4.A.3)
CC  Bacterial PTS transporters transport and concomitantly phosphorylate their sugar substrates, and typically consist of multiple subunits or protein domains.
CC  The Lac family includes several sequenced lactose (b-galactoside) permeases of Gram-positive bacteria as well as the E. coli N,N?-diacetylchitobiose (Chb)
CC  permease which can transport aromatic b-glucosides and cellobiose as well as the chitin disaccharide, Chb, but only Chb induces expression of the chb
CC  operon. While the Lac permeases consist of two polypeptide chains (IIA and IICB), the Chb permease of E. coli consists of three (IIA, IIB and IIC). In B. subtilis, a PTS permease similar to the Chb permease of E. coli is believed to transport lichenan (a b-1,3;1,4 glucan) degradation products, oligosaccharides of 2-4 glucose units. This Hmm is specific for the IIA subunit of the Lac PTS family.
