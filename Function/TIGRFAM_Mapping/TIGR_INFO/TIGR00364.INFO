CC  Members of this protein family are QueC, involved in synthesizing pre-Q0 from GTP en route to tRNA modification with queuosine. This protein family is represented by a single member in nearly every completed large (> 1000 genes) prokaryotic genome. In Rhizobium meliloti, the gene was designated exsB, possibly because of polar effects on exsA expression in a shared polycistronic mRNA. In Arthrobacter viscosus, the homologous gene was designated ALU1 and was associated with an aluminum tolerance phenotype.
