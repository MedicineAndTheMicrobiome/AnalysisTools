CC  Members of this protein family are found only in endospore-forming bacteria, such as Bacillus subtilis and Clostridium tetani. Among such bacteria, it appears only Symbiobacterium thermophilum lacks a member of this family. The protein, designated BofA, is an integral membrane protein that regulates the proteolytic activation of the RNA polymerase sigma factor K.
