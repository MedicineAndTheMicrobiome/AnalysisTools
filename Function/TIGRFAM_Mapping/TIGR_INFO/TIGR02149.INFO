CC  This model describes Corynebacterium glutamicum GlgA and closely related proteins in several other species. This enzyme is required for glycogen biosynthesis and appears to replace the distantly related TIGR02095 family of ADP-glucose type glycogen synthase in Corynebacterium glutamicum, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Bifidobacterium longum, and Streptomyces coelicolor.
