CC  This model describes one of two paralogous families of archaealflavoprotein. The other, described by TIGR02699 and typified by the partially characterized AF1518 of Archaeoglobus fulgidus, is a homodimeric FMN-containing flavoprotein that accepts electrons from ferredoxin and can transfer them to various oxidoreductases. The function of this protein family is unknown.
