CC  This family consists of GroEL, the larger subunit of the GroEL/GroES cytosolic chaperonin. It is found in bacteria, organelles derived from bacteria, and occasionally in the Archaea. The bacterial GroEL/GroES group I chaperonin is replaced a group II chaperonin, usually called the thermosome in the Archaeota and CCT (chaperone-containing TCP) in the Eukaryota. GroEL, thermosome subunits, and CCT subunits all fall under the scope of Pfam model PF00118.
