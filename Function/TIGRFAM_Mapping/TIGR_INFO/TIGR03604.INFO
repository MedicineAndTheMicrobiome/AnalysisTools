CC  Members of this protein family include enzymes related to SagD, previously referred to as a scaffold or docking protein involved in the biosynthesis of streptolysin S in Streptococcus pyogenes from the protoxin polypeptide (product of the sagA gene). Newer evidence describes an enzymatic activity, an ATP-dependent cyclodehydration reaction, previously ascribed to the SagC component. This protein family serves as a marker for widely distributed prokaryotic systems for making a general class of heterocycle-containing bacteriocins.
