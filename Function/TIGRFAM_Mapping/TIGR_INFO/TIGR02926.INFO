CC  he A1/A0 ATP synthase is homologous to the V-type (V1/V0, vacuolar) ATPase, but functions in the ATP synthetic direction as does the F1/F0 ATPase of bacteria.  The hydrophilic A1 "stalk" complex (AhaABCDEFG) [1] is the site of ATP generation and is coupled to the membrane-embedded proton translocating A0 complex.  It is unclear precisely where AhaH fits into these complexes.
