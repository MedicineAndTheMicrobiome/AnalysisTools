CC  Aminoacylation of tRNA(Cys) with Cys, and cysteine biosynthesis in the process, happens in Methanocaldococcus jannaschii and several other archaea by misacylation of tRNA(Cys) with O-phosphoserine (Sep), followed by modification of the phosphoserine to cysteine. In some species, direct tRNA-cys aminoacylation also occurs but this pathway is required for Cys biosynthesis. Members of this protein catalyze the second step in this two step pathway, using pyridoxal phosphate and a sulfur donor to synthesize Cys from Sep while attached to the tRNA.
