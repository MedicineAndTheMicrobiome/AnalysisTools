CC  The Pfam domain family PF00296 is named for luciferase-like monooxygenases, but the family also contains several coenzyme F420-dependent enzymes. This protein family represents a well-resolved clade within family PF00296 and shows no restriction to coenzyme F420-positive species, unlike some other clades within PF00296.
