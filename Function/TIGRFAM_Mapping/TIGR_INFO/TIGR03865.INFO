TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  Members of this protein family have a CXXXCW motif, consistent with a possible role in redox cofactor binding. This protein family shows strong relationships by phylogenetic profiling and conserved gene neighborhoods with a transport system for alcohols metabolized by PQQ-dependent enzymes.
