CC  This uncharacterized protein family, part of the PIN domain superfamily, is restricted to bacteria and archaea. A comprehensive in silico study of toxin-antitoxin systems by Makarova, et al. (2009) finds evidence this family represents the toxin-like component of one class of type 2 toxin-antitoxin systems.
