EN  type III secretion effector delivery regulator, TyeA family
TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  Members of this family include both small proteins, about 90 amino acids, in which this model covers the whole, and longer proteins of about 360 residues which match in the C-terminal region. The longer proteins (HrpJ) have N-terminal regions that match Pfam model PF07201. Members of this family belong to bacterial type III secretion systems, and include TyeA from the well-studied Yersinia systems. TyeA appears involved in calcium-responsive regulation of the delivery of type III effectors.

RT  TyeA of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis is involved in regulation of Yop expression and is required for polarized translocation of Yop effectors.
