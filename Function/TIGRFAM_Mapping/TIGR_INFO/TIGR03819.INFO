CC  Members of this protein family comprise a distinct clade of putative ATPase associated with an integral membrane complex likely to act in pilus formation, secretion, or conjugal transfer. The association of most members with a nearby gene for a DEAH-box helicase suggests a role in conjugal transfer.
