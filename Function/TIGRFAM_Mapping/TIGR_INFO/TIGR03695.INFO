CC  This protein catalyzes the formation of SHCHC, or (1 R,6 R)-2-succinyl-6-hydroxy-2,4-cyclohexadiene-1-carboxylate, by elmination of pyruvate from 2-succinyl-5-enolpyruvyl-6-hydroxy-3-cyclohexene-1-carboxylate (SEPHCHC). Note that SHCHC synthase activity previously was attributed to MenD, which in fact is SEPHCHC synthase.
