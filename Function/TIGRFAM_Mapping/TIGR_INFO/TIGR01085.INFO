CC  Most members of this family are EC 6.3.2.13, UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanyl-D-glutamate--2,6-diaminopimelate ligase. An exception is Staphylococcus aureus, in which diaminopimelate is replaced by lysine in the peptidoglycan and MurE is EC 6.3.2.7. The Mycobacteria, part of the closest neighboring branch outside of the low-GC Gram-positive bacteria, use diaminopimelate.
CC  A close homolog, scoring just below the trusted cutoff, is found (with introns) in Arabidopsis thaliana. Its role is unknown.
