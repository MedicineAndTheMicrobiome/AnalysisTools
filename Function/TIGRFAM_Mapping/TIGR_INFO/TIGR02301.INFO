CC  Members of this uncharacterized protein family are found in a number of alphaProteobacteria, including root nodule bacteria, Brucella suis, Caulobacter crescentus, and Rhodopseudomonas palustris. Conserved residues include two well-separated cysteines, suggesting a disulfide bond. The function is unknown.
