CC  Bacterial PTS transporters transport and concomitantly phosphorylate their sugar substrates, and typically consist of multiple subunits or protein domains. The Gut family consists only of glucitol-specific transporters, but these occur both in Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria.E. coli consists of IIA protein, a IIC protein and a IIBC protein. This family is specific for the IIC component.
