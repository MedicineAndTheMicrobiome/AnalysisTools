CC  This model describes N5-methyltetrahydromethanopterin:
CC  coenzyme M methyltransferase subunit C in methanogenic archaea. This methyltranferase is membrane-associated enzyme complex that uses methyl-transfer reaction to drive sodium-ion pump. Archaea have evolved energy-yielding pathways marked by one-carbon biochemistry featuring novel cofactors and enzymes. This transferase is involved in the transfer of 'methyl' group from N5-methyltetrahydromethanopterin to coenzyme M. In an accompanying reaction, methane is produced by two-electron reduction of the methyl moiety in methyl-coenzyme M by another enzyme methyl-coenzyme M reductase.
