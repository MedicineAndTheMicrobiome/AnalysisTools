CC  CRISPR is a term for Clustered, Regularly Interspaced Short Palidromic Repeats. A number of protein families appear only in association with these repeats and are designated Cas (CRISPR-Associated) proteins. This HMM family, represented by TM1791.1 of Thermotoga maritima, is found in both archaeal and bacterial species as part of the 6-gene CRISPR RAMP module.
