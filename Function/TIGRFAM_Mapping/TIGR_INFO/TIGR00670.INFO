CC  Aspartate transcarbamylase (ATCase) is an alternate name.
CC  PyrB encodes the catalytic chain of aspartate carbamoyltransferase, an enzyme of pyrimidine biosynthesis, which organizes into trimers. In some species, including E. coli and the Archaea but excluding Bacillus subtilis, a regulatory subunit PyrI is also present in an allosterically regulated hexameric holoenzyme. Several molecular weight classes of ATCase are described in MEDLINE:96303527 and often vary within taxa. PyrB and PyrI are fused in Thermotoga maritima.
CC  Ornithine carbamoyltransferases are in the same superfamily and form an outgroup.
