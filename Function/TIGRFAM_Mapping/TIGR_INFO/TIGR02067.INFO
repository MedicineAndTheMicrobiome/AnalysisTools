CC  This subfamily belongs to the inositol monophosphatase family (PF00459). The members of this family consist of no more than one per species and are found only in species in which histidine is synthesized de novo but no histidinol phosphatase can be found in either of the two described families (TIGR01261, TIGR01856). In at least one species, the member of this family is found near known histidine biosynthesis genes. The role as histidinol-phosphatase wsa first proven in Corynebacterium glutamicum.
