TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  Members of this protein family belong to the LuxR transcriptional regulator family, and contain both autoinducer binding (PF03472) and transcriptional regulator (PF00196) domains. Members, however, occur only in a few members of the Gammaproteobacteria that have the chaperone/aminopeptidase HchA, and are always encoded by the adjacent gene.
