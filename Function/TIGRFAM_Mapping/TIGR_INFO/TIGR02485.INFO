CC  CobZ is essential for cobalamin biosynthesis (by knockout of the R. capsulatus gene [1]) and is complemented by the characterized precorrin 3B synthase CobG.  The enzyme has been shown to contain flavin, heme and Fe-S cluster cofactors and is believed to require dioxygen as a substrate.  This model identifies the N-terminal portion of the R. capsulatus gene which, in other species exists as a separate protein.  The C-terminal portion is homologous to the 2-component signal transduction system protein CitB (TIGR02484).
