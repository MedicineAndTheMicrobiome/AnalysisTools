CC  This HMM describes farnesyl-diphosphate farnesyltransferase, also known as squalene synthase, as found in eukaryotes. This family is related to phytoene synthases. Tentatively identified archaeal homologs (excluded from this model) lack the C-terminal predicted transmembrane region universally conserved among members of this family.
