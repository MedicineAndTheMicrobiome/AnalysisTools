CC  In some species, histidine is converted to via urocanate and then formimino-L-glutamate to glutamate in four steps, where the fourth step is conversion of N-formimino-L-glutamate to L-glutamate and formamide. In others, that pathway from formimino-L-glutamate may differ, with the next enzyme being formiminoglutamate hydrolase (HutF) yielding N-formyl-L-glutamate. This HMM represents the enzyme  N-formylglutamate deformylase, also called N-formylglutamate amidohydrolase, which then produces glutamate.
