CC  Members of this protein family are YgfK, predicted to be one subunit of a three-subunit, molybdopterin-containing selenate reductase. This enzyme is found, typically, in genomic regions associated with xanthine dehydrogenase homologs predicted to belong to the selenium-dependent molybdenum hydroxylases (SDMH). Therefore, the selenate reductase is suggested to play a role in furnishing selenide for SelD, the selenophosphate synthase.
