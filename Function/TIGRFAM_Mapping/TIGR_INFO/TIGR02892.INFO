CC  Members of this protein family are the YabP protein of the bacterial sporulation program, as found in Bacillus subtilis, Clostridium tetani, and other spore-forming members of the Firmicutes. In Bacillus subtilis, a yabP single mutant appears to sporulate and germinate normally (PMID:11283287), but is in an operon with yabQ (essential for formation of the spore cortex), it near-universal among endospore-forming bacteria, and is found nowhere else. It is likely, therefore, that YabP does have a function in sporulation or germination, one that is either unappreciated or partially redundant with that of another protein.
