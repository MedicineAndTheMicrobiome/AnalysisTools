CC  This model describes a narrow clade of cyanobacterial deoxyribodipyrimidine photo-lyase. This group, in contrast to several closely related proteins, uses a chromophore that, in other lineages is modified further to become coenzyme F420. This chromophore is called 8-HDF in most articles on the DNA photolyase and FO in most literature on coenzyme F420.
