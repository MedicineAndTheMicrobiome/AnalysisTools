CC  Archaea, organelles, and many bacteria charge Gln-tRNA by first misacylating it with Glu and then amidating Glu to Gln. This small protein is part of the amidotransferase heterotrimer and appears to be important to the stability of the amidase subunit encode by gatA, but its function may not be required in every organism that expresses gatA and gatB.
CC  The seed alignment for this HMM does not include any eukaryotic sequence and is not guaranteed to find eukaryotic examples, although it does find some. Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which expresses the amidotransferase for mitochondrial protein translation, seems to lack a gatC ortholog.
CC  This HMM has been revised to remove the candidate sequence from Methanococcus jannaschii, now part of a related model.
