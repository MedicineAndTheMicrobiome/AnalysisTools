CC  This HMM describes tyrosine aminotransferase as found in animals and Trypanosoma cruzi. It is the first enzyme of a pathway of tyrosine degradation via homogentisate. Several plant enzyme designated as probable tyrosine aminotransferases are very closely related to an experimentally demonstrated nicotianamine aminotransferase, an enzyme in a siderophore (iron uptake chelator) biosynthesis pathway. These plant sequences are excluded from the model seed and score between the trusted an noise cutoffs.
