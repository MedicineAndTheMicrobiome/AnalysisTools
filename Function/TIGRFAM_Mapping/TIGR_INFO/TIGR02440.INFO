CC  Members represent alpha subunit of multifunctional enzyme complex of the fatty acid degradation cycle. Plays a minor role in aerobic beta-oxidation of fatty acids. FadJI complex is necessary for anaerobic growth on short-chain acids with nitrate as an electron acceptor. Activities include: enoyl-CoA hydratase (EC 4.2.1.17),3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.35), 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA epimerase (EC 5.1.2.3). A representative is E. coli FadJ (aka YfcX) (SP:P77399). This model excludes the FadB of TIGR02437 equivalog hmm.
