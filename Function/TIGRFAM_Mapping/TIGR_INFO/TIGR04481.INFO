CC  Members of this family are encoded near the prdA and prdB genes for proteins of the proline reductase complex, are induced by proline, and are designated PrdC by Bouillaut, et al. Some members are selenoproteins (at two different positions), as is PrdB. Members are homologous to, but distinct from, electron transport protein RnfC.
