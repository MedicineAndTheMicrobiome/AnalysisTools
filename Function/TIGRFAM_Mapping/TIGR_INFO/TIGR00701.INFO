CC  It appears this conserved hypothetical integral membrane protein is found only in gram negative bacteria. Completed genomes that include a member of this family include Rickettsia prowazekii, Synechocystis sp. PCC6803, and Helicobacter pylori. These proteins have 3 (Helicobacter pylori) to 5 (Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803) GES predicted transmembrane regions.  Most members have 4 GES predicted transmembrane regions.
