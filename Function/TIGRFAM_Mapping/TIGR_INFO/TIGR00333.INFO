CC  Ribonucleotide reductases (RNRs) are enzymes that provide the precursors of DNA synthesis. The three characterized classes of RNRs differ by their metal cofactor and their stable organic radical. The exact function of nrdI within the ribonucleotide reductases has not yet been fully characterised.
