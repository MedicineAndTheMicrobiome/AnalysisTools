CC  This small protein, about 90 residues long, has no detectable homologs outside the set included about trusted cutoff for this HMM. Member proteins serve as markers for an eight-gene region whose overall function is unknown. One member of the cluster is a radical SAM protein with some similarity to enzymes of cofactor biosynthesis, another a glycosyltransferase, several hydrolases or oxidoreductases, and several unknown.
