CC  This model represents a clade of probable chorismate mutases from alpha, beta and gamma proteobacteria as well as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and a clade of nematodes.  Although the most likely function for the enzymes represented by this model is as a chorismate mutase, in no species are these enzymes the sole chorismate mutase in the genome.  Also, in no case are these enzymes located in a region of the genome proximal to any other enzymes involved in chorismate pathways.  Although the Pantoea enzyme has been shown to complement a CM-free mutant of E. coli [1], this was also shown to be the case with isochorismate-pyruvate lyase which only has a secondary (non-physiologically relevant) chorismate mutase activity [2].  This enzyme is believed to be a homodimer and be localized to the periplasm.
