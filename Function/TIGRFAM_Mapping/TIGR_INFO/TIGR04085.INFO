CC  This domain contains regions binding additional 4Fe4S clusters found in various radical SAM proteins C-terminal to the domain described by model PF04055. Radical SAM enzymes with this domain tend to be involved in protein modification, including anaerobic sulfatase maturation proteins, a quinohemoprotein amine dehydrogenase biogenesis protein, the Pep1357-cyclizing radical SAM enzyme, and various bacteriocin biosynthesis proteins. The motif CxxCxxxxxCxxxC is nearly invariant for members of this family, although PqqE has a variant form. We name this domain SPASM for Subtilosin, PQQ, Anaerobic Sulfatase, and Mycofactocin.
