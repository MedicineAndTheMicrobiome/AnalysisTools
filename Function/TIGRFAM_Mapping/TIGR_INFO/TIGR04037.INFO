CC  This family represents a distinct clade within PF03358. That family includes enzymes such as the NADH-dependent FMN reductase MsuE. Members of the present family regularly co-occur in genomes, typically as gene pairs, with members of TIGR04036, a probable FMN-dependent member of the bacterial luciferase-like monooxygenase (LLM) family. At least one member, RF|YP_001509627.1 from Frankia sp. EAN1pec, is fused to the LLM protein. The function of these gene pairs is unknown.
