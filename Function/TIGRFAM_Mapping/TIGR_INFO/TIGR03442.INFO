CC  Members of this strictly bacterial protein family show similarity to class II glutamine amidotransferases (see Pfam family PF00310). They are distinguished by appearing in a genome context with, and usually adjacent to or between, members of families TIGR03438 (an uncharacterized methyltransferase) and TIGR03440 (an uncharacterized protein).
