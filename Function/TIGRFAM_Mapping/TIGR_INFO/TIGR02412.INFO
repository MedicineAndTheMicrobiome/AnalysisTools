CC  This family is a subset of the members of the zinc metallopeptidase family M1 (PF01433), with a single member characterized in Streptomyces lividans 66 and designated aminopeptidase N. The spectrum of activity may differ somewhat from the aminopeptidase N clade of E. coli and most other Proteobacteria, well separated phylogenetically within the M1 family. The M1 family also includes leukotriene A-4 hydrolase/aminopeptidase (with a bifunctional active site).
