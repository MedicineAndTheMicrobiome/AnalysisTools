CC  Methionine aminopeptidase (map) is a cobalt-binding enzyme. Bacterial and organellar examples (type I) differ from eukaroytic and archaeal (type II) examples in lacking a region of approximately 60 amino acids between the 4th and 5th cobalt-binding ligands. The role of this protein in general is to produce the mature amino end of cytosolic proteins by removing the N-terminal methionine. This model describes type II, among which the eukaryotic members typically have an N-terminal extension not present in archaeal members. It can act cotranslationally. The enzyme from rat has been shown to associate with translation initiation factor 2 (IF-2) and may have a role in translational regulation.
