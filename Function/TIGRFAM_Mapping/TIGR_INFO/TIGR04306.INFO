CC  The TenA protein of Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aurues, and the C-terminal region of trifunctional protein Thi20p from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, perform cleavages on thiamine and related compounds to produce 4-amino-5-hydroxymethyl-2-methylpyrimidine (HMP), a substrate a salvage pathway for thiamine biosynthesis. The gene symbol tenA, for Transcription ENhancement A, reflects a misleading early characterization as a regulatory protein. This family is related to PqqC from the PQQ biosynthesis system (see TIGR02111), heme oxygenase (PF01126), and CADD (Chlamydia protein Associating with Death Domains), a putative folate metabolism enzyme (see TIGR04305).
