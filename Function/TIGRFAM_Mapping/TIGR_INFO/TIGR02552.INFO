EN  type III secretion low calcium response chaperone LcrH/SycD
TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  Genes in this family are found in type III secretion operons.  LcrH, from Yersinia is believed to have a regulatory function in the low-calcium response of the secretion system [1,2].  The same protein is also known as SycD (SYC = Specific Yop Chaperone) for its chaperone role [3].  In Pseudomonas, where the homolog is known as PcrH, the chaperone role has been demonstrated and the regulatory role appears to be absent [4].
CC  ScyD/LcrH contains three central tetratricopeptide-like repeats that are predicted to fold into an all-alpha-helical array [5].
