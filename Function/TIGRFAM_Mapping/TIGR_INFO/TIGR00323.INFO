CC  This HMM finds translation initiation factor eIF-6 of eukaryotes, which is a ribosome dissociation factor. It also finds a set of apparent archaeal orthologs, slightly shorter proteins not yet shown to act as initiation factors; these probably should be designated as translation initiation factor aIF-6, putative.
