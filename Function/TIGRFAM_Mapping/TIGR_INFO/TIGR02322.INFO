CC  Members of this family resemble PhnN of phosphonate utilization operons, where different such operons confer the ability to use somewhat different profiles of C-P bond-containing compounds (see PMID:15231805), including phosphites as well as phosphonates. PhnN in E. coli shows considerable homology to guanylate kinases (EC 2.7.4.8), and has actually been shown to act as a ribose 1,5-bisphosphokinase (PRPP forming). This suggests an analogous kinase reaction for phosphonate metabolism, converting 5-phosphoalpha-1-(methylphosphono)ribose to methylphosphono-PRPP.
