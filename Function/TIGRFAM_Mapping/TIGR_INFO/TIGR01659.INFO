CC  This model describes the sex-lethal family of splicing factors found in Dipteran insects.  The sex-lethal phenotype, however, may be limited to the Melanogasters and closely related species [1].  In Drosophila the protein acts as an inhibitor of splicing.  This subfamily is most closely related to the ELAV/HUD subfamily of splicing factors (TIGR01661).
