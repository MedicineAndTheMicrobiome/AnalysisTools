CC  This model represents the C-terminal domain or EccCb subunit of the type VII secretion protein EccC as found in the Actinobacteria. Type VII secretion is defined more broadly as including secretion systems for ESAT-6-like proteins in the Firmicutes as well as in the Actinobacteria, but this family does not show close homologs in the Firmicutes.
