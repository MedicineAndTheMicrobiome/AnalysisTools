CC  PSI-BLAST, starting with a urease alpha subunit, finds a large superfamily of proteins, including a number of different enzymes that act as hydrolases at C-N bonds other than peptide bonds (EC 3.5.-.-), many uncharacterized proteins, and the members of this family.
CC  Several genomes have multiple paralogs related to this family. However, a set of 17 proteins can be found, one each from 17 of the first 20 genomes, such that each member forms a bidirectional best hit across genomes with all other members of the set. This core set (and one other near-perfect member), but not the other paralogs, form the seed for this model. Additionally, members of the seed alignment and all trusted hits, but not all paralogs, have a conserved motif DxHxH near the amino end. The member from E. coli was recently shown to have DNase activity.

RT  TatD is a cytoplasmic protein with DNase activity. No requirement for TatD family proteins in sec-independent protein export.
