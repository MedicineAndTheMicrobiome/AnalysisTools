CC  Members of this family include sll0787 from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and resemble the C-terminal region of MSMEG_0567 from Mycobacterium smegmatis, where the N-terminal is a GNAT family N-acetyltransferase. The conserved cluster is found broadly (Cyanobacteria, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria) in about 8 percent of genomes and appears to be biosynthetic. The product is unkown.
