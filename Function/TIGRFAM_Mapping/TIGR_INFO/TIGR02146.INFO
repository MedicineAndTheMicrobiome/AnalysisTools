CC  This model includes the yeast LYS21 gene which carries out the first step of the alpha-aminoadipate (AAA) lysine biosynthesis pathway.  A related pathway is found in Thermus thermophilus [1].  This enzyme is closely related to 2-isopropylmalate synthase (LeuA) and citramalate synthase (CimA), both of which are present in the euryarchaeota.  Some archaea have a separate homocitrate synthase (AksA) which also synthesizes longer homocitrate analogs [2].
