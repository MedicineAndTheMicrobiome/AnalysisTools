CC  These eukaryotic proteins recognize the poly-A of mRNA and consists of four tandem RNA recognition domains at the N-terminus (rrm: PF00076) followed by a PABP-specific domain (PF00658) at the C-terminus.  The protein is involved in the transport of mRNA's from the nucleus to the cytoplasm [3].
CC  There are four paralogs in Homo sapiens which are expressed in testis (GP:11610605_PABP3 [1]), platelets (SP:Q13310_PABP4 [2]), broadly expressed (SP:P11940_PABP1 [3]) and of unknown tissue range (SP:Q15097_PABP2).
