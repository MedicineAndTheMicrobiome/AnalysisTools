CC  Members of this family are bona fide SoxY, the sulfate carrier protein with the GGCGG ir GGCG swinging arm C-terminal sequence. The Cys in the swinging arm is the residue to which the inorganic sulfate moiety becomes covalently attached. In some species, a closely related paralog occurs as well (TIGR04487), with a swinging arm sequence AACIE. More distantly related forms have an additional C-terminal SoxZ-related domain. All members are periplasmic and have an N-terminal twin-arginine translocation (TAT) signal sequence.
