TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  Members of this family have both a B12 binding homology domain (PF02310) and a radical SAM domain (PF04055), and occur only once per genome. Some species with members of this family have a related protein with similar domain architecture. This protein is occurs largely in archaeal methanogens but also in a few bacteria, including Thermotoga maritima and Myxococcus xanthus.
