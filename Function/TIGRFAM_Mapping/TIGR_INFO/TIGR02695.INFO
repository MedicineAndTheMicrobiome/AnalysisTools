CC  Azurin is a blue copper-binding protein in the plastocyanin/azurin family (see Pfam model PF00127). It serves as a redox partner to enzymes such as nitrite reductase or arsenite oxidase. The most closely related copper-binding proteins to this family are auracyanins, as in Chloroflexus aurantiacus, which have similar redox activities.
