CC  Members of this family belong the lacI helix-turn-helix family (PF00356) of DNA-binding transcriptional regulators. All members are from the proteobacteria. Characterized members act as positive and negative transcriptional regulators of fructose and sucrose transport and metabolism. Sucrose is a disaccharide composed of fructose and glucose; D-fructose-1-phosphate rather than an intact sucrose moiety has been shown to act as the inducer.
