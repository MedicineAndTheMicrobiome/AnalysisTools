EN  putative HD superfamily hydrolase of NAD metabolism
TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  The function of this protein family is unknown. Members of this family of uncharacterized proteins from the Mycoplasmas are longer at the amino end, fused to a region of nicotinamide nucleotide adenylyltransferase, an NAD salvage biosynthesis enzyme. Members are putative metal-dependent phosphohydrolases  for NAD metabolism.
