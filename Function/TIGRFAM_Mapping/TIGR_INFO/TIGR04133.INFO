CC  Members of this protein family are radical SAM enzymes with an additional 4Fe4S cluster-binding C-terminal domain (TIGR04085) shared with PqqE and many other peptide and protein-modifying radical SAM enzymes. All members occur in the context of a predicted lipoprotein that usually is encoded by an adjacent gene.
