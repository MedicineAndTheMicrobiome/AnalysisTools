CC  Flavodoxins are small redox-active proteins with a flavin mononucleotide (FMN) prosthetic group. They can act in nitrogen fixation by nitrogenase, in sulfite reduction, and light-dependent NADP+ reduction in during photosynthesis, among other roles. This model describes the short chain type. Many of these are involved in sulfite reduction.
