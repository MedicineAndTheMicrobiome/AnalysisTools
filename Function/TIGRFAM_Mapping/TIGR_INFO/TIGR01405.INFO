CC  This HMM describes a polypeptide chain of DNA polymerase III. Full-length homologs of this protein are restricted to the Gram-positive lineages, including the Mycoplasmas. This protein is designated alpha chain and given the gene symbol polC, but is not a full-length homolog of other polC genes.
CC  The N-terminal region of about 200 amino acids is rich in low-complexity sequence, poorly alignable, and not included n this model.
