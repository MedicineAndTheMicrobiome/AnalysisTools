CC  Members of this protein family are the CwlD family of N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase. This family has been called the germination-specific N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase. CwlD is required, along with the putative deactylase PdaA, to make muramic delta-lactam, a novel peptidoglycan constituent found only in spores. CwlD mutants show a germination defect.
