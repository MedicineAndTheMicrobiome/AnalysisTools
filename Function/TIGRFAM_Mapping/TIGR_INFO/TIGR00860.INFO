CC  The Ligand-gated Ion Channel (LIC) Family of Neurotransmitter Receptors TC 1.A.9)
CC  Members of the LIC family of ionotropic neurotransmitter receptors are found only in vertebrate and invertebrate animals. They exhibit receptor specificity for (1)
CC  acetylcholine, (2) serotonin, (3) glycine, (4) glutamate and (5) g-aminobutyric acid (GABA). All of these receptor channels are probably hetero- or
CC  homopentameric. The best characterized are the nicotinic acetyl-choline receptors which are pentameric channels of a2bgd subunit composition. All subunits are
CC  homologous. The three dimensional structures of the protein complex in both the open and closed configurations have been solved at 0.9 nm resolution.
CC  The channel protein complexes of the LIC family preferentially transport cations or anions depending on the channel (e.g., the acetylcholine receptors are cation
CC  selective while glycine receptors are anion selective).
