CC  7-keto-8-aminopelargonic acid synthetase is an alternate name.
CC  This model represents 8-amino-7-oxononanoate synthase, the BioF protein of biotin biosynthesis. This model is based on a careful phylogenetic analysis to separate members of this family from 2-amino-3-ketobutyrate and other related pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enzymes. In several species, including Staphylococcus and Coxiella, a candidate 8-amino-7-oxononanoate synthase is confirmed by location in the midst of a biotin biosynthesis operon but scores below the trusted cutoff of this model.
