CC  This model represents one branch of COG0042 (Predicted TIM-barrel enzymes, possibly dehydrogenases, nifR3 family). It represents a distinct subset by a set of shared unique motifs, a conserved pattern of insertions/deletions relative to other nifR3 homologs, and by subclustering based on cross-genome bidirectional best hits. Members are found in species as diverse as the proteobacteria, a spirochete, a cyanobacterium, and Deinococcus radiodurans. NifR3 itself, a protein of unknown function associated with nitrogen regulation in Rhodobacter capsulatus, is not a member of this branch.
CC  Members of this family show a distant relationship to alpha/beta (TIM) barrel enzymes such as dihydroorotate dehydrogenase and glycolate oxidase.
