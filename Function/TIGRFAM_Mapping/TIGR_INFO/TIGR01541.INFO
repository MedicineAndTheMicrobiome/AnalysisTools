EN  phage tail tape measure protein, lambda family
TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  This HMM represents a relatively well-conserved region near the C-terminus of the tape measure protein of a lambda and related phage. This protein, which controls phage tail length, is typically about 1000 residues in length. Both low-complexity sequence and insertion/deletion events appear common in this family. Mutational studies suggest a ruler or template role in the determination of phage tail length. Similar behavior is attributed to proteins from distantly related or unrelated families in other phage.
