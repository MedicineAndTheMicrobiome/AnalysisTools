CC  Members of this family are WaaZ, or Kdo-III transferase. This enzyme, present in some strains of E. coli and its allies but not others, performs a non-stoichiometric addition of a third 3-deoxy-D-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid (KDO-III) onto some fraction of KDO-II in the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) inner core.
