CC  Members of this protein family, including VC_A0118 from Vibrio cholerae El Tor N16961, are restricted to a subset of bacteria with the type VI secretion system, and are encoded among the type VI-associated pathogenicity islands. However, many species with type VI secretion lack a member of this family. This lack suggests that members of this family may be targets rather than components of the type VI secretion system.
