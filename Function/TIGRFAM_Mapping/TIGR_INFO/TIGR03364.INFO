CC  This clade of FAD dependent oxidoreductases (members of the PF01266 family) is syntenically associated with a family of proposed phosphonatase-like enzymes (TIGR03351) and is also found (less frequently) in association with phosphonate transporter components.  A likely role for this enzyme involves the oxidative deamination of an aminophosphonate differring slightly from 2-aminoethylphosphonate, possibly 1-hydroxy-2-aminoethylphosphonate (see the comments for TIGR03351).  Many members of the larger FAD dependent oxidoreductase family act as amino acid oxidative deaminases.
