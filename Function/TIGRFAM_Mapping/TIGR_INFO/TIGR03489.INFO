CC  Members of this protein family are Csp1, a CRISPR-associated (cas) gene marker for the Pging subtype of CRISPR/cas system, as found in Porphyromonas gingivalis W83 and Bacteroides forsythus ATCC 43037. This protein belongs to the family of DevR (TIGR01875), a regulator of development in Myxococcus xanthus located in a cas gene region. A different branch of the DevR family, Cst2 (TIGR02585), is a marker for the Tneap subtype of CRISPR/cas system.
