CC  Members of this protein family are small (~ 80 amino acids) and occur in biosynthesis clusters for cyanobactins, a type of ribosomal natural product, thiazole/oxazole-modified microcin (TOMM). The function of this protein family is unknown, and the recognized cyanobactin precursors (e.g. microcyclamides and patellamides) are encoded by a different protein (see TIGR03678). In this protein family, however, a core region of about 62 amino acids (modeled) is followed by a hypervariable region of 5 to 23 amino acids, with hallmarks of possible cyclodehydratase modification sites. The hallmarks include Cys residues flanked by Gly, and variable length Ser-rich tripeptide repeats. Further, members of this family were shown dispensible for patellamide biosynthesis, and two may occur in a cluster. Therefore, this family may represent a precursor of another type of ribosomal natural product.
