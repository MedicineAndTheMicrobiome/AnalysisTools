CC  Members of this family are the Psb27 protein of the cyanobacterial photosynthetic supracomplex, photosystem II. Although most protein components of both cyanobacterial and chloroplast versions of photosystem II are closely related and described together by single HMM families, this family is strictly bacterial. Some uncharacterized proteins with highly divergent sequences, from Arabidopsis, score between trusted and noise cutoffs for this model but are not at this time assigned as functionally equivalent photosystem II proteins.
