CC  Thymidine phosphorylase (alternate name: pyrimidine phosphorylase), EC 2.4.2.4, is the designation for the enzyme of E. coli and other Proteobacteria involved in (deoxy)nucleotide degradation. It often occurs in an operon with a deoxyribose-phosphate aldolase, phosphopentomutase and a purine nucleoside phosphorylase. In many other lineages, the corresponding enzyme is designated pyrimidine-nucleoside phosphorylase (EC 2.4.2.2); the naming convention imposed by this model represents standard literature practice.
