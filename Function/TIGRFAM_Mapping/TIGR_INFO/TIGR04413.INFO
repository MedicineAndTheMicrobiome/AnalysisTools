CC  Members of this family occur only in CRISPR/cas loci of the MYXAN type, but are present in a minority of such systems. This protein appears to replace the MYXAN system Cas8a1/Csx13 protein (TIGR03485/TIGR03486), compared to which it shows similar length and composition but only about 12 percent sequence identity.
