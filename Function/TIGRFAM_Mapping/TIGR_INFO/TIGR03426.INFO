CC  Members of this protein family are the MreD protein of bacterial cell shape determination. Most rod-shaped bacteria depend on MreB and RodA to achieve either a rod shape or some other non-spherical morphology such as coil or stalk formation. MreD is encoded in an operon with MreB, and often with RodA and PBP-2 as well. It is highly hydrophobic (therefore somewhat low-complexity) and highly divergent, and therefore sometimes tricky to discover by homology, but this model finds most examples.
