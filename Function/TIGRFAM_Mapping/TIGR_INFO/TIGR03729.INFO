CC  Members of this protein family belong to the larger family PF00149 (calcineurin-like phosphoesterase), a family largely defined by small motifs of metal-chelating residues. The subfamily in this model shows a good but imperfect co-occurrence in species with domain TIGR03715 that defines a novel class of signal peptide typical of the accessory secretory system.
