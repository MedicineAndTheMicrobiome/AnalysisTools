EN  type III secretion protein LcrG
TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  This protein is found in type III secretion operons, along with LcrR, H and V.  Also known as PcrG in Pseudomonas, the protein is believed to make a 1:1 complex with PcrV (LcrV) [1].  Mutants of LcrG cause premature secretion of effector proteins into the medium  [2].
