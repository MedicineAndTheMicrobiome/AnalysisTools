CC  Members of this protein family are 1-pyrroline dehydrogenase (1.5.1.35), also called gamma-aminobutyraldehyde dehydrogenase. This enzyme can follow putrescine transaminase (EC 2.6.1.82) for a two-step conversion of putrescine to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). The member from Escherichia coli is characterized as a homotetramer that binds one NADH per momomer. This enzyme belongs to the medium-chain aldehyde dehydrogenases, and is quite similar in sequence to the betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.8) family.
