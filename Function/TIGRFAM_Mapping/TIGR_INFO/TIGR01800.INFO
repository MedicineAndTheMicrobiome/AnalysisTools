CC  Members of this family are dimeric enzymes with activity as 2-methylcitrate synthase, citrate synthase, or both. Many Gram-negative species have a hexameric citrate synthase, termed citrate synthase I (TIGR01798). Members of this family (TIGR01800) appear as a second citrate synthase isozyme but typically are associated with propionate metabolism and synthesize 2-methylcitrate from propionyl-CoA; citrate synthase activity may be incidental. A number of species, including Thermoplasma acidophilum, Pyrococcus furiosus, and the Antarctic bacterium DS2-3R have a bifunctional member of this family as the only citrate synthase isozyme.
