CC  This protein family consists of HisA, phosphoribosylformimino-5-aminoimidazole carboxamide ribotide isomerase, the enzyme catalyzing the fourth step in histidine biosynthesis. It is closely related to the enzyme HisF for the sixth step.
CC  Examples of this enzyme in Actinobacteria have been found to be bifunctional, also possessing phosphoribosylanthranilate isomerase activity [1]; the trusted cutoff here has now been raised to 275.0 to exclude the bifunctional group, now represented by model TIGR01919. HisA from Lactococcus lactis was reported to be inactive (MEDLINE:93322317).
