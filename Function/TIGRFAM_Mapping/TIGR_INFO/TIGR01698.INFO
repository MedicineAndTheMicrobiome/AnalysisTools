CC  This clade of purine nucleotide phosphorylases has not been experimentally characterized but is assigned based on strong sequence homology.  Closely related clades act on inosine and 
CC  guanosine (PNPH, TIGR01700), and xanthosine, inosine and guanosine (XAPA, TIGR01699) neither of these will act on adenosine.  A more distantly related clade (MTAP, TIGR01694) acts on 
CC  methylthioadenosine.
