EN  pyridine nucleotide-disulfide oxidoreductase family protein
TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  Members of this protein family include N-terminal sequence regions of (probable) bifunctional proteins whose C-terminal sequences are SelD, or selenide,water dikinase, the selenium donor protein necessary for selenium incorporation into protein (as selenocysteine), tRNA (as 2-selenouridine), or both. However, some members of this family occur in species that do not show selenium incorporation, and the function of this protein family is unknown.
