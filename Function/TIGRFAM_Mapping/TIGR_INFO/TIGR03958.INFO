CC  Members of this protein family are HmdC, whose gene regularly occurs in the context of genes for HmdA (5,10-methenyltetrahydromethanopterin hydrogenase) and the radical SAM protein HmdB involved in biosynthesis of the HmdA cofactor. Bioinformatics suggests this protein, a homolog of eukaryotic fibrillarin, may be involved in biosynthesis of the guanylyl pyridinol cofactor in HmdA.
