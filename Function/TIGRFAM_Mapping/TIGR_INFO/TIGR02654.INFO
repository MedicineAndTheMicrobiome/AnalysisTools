CC  Members of this protein family are the circadian clock protein KaiB of Cyanobacteria, encoded in the circadian clock gene cluster kaiABC. KaiB has homologs of unknown function in some Archaea and Proteobacteria, and has paralogs of unknown function in some Cyanobacteria. KaiB forms homodimers, homotetramers, and multimeric complexes with KaiA and/or KaiC.
