CC  This family describes the well-studied thioredoxin-dependent arsenate reductase of Staphylococcus aureaus plasmid pI258 and other mechanistically similar arsenate reductases. The mechanism involves an intramolecular disulfide bond cascade, and aligned members of this family have four absolutely conserved Cys residues. This group of arsenate reductases belongs to the low-molecular weight protein-tyrosine phosphatase family (PF01451), as does a group of glutathione/glutaredoxin type arsenate reductases (TIGR02689). At least two other, non-homologous groups of arsenate reductases involved in arsenical resistance are also known. This enzyme reduces arsenate to arsenite, which may be more toxic but which is more easily exported.
