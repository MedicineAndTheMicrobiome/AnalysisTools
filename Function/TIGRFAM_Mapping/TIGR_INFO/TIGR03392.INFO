CC  Members of this protein family are CsdS. This protein, found Escherichia coli, Yersinia pestis, Photorhabdus luminescens, and related species, and related to SufS, works together with and physically interacts with CsdE (a paralog of SufE). CsdA has cysteine desulfurase activity that is enhanced by CsdE, a sulfur acceptor protein. This gene pair, although involved in FeS cluster biosynthesis, is not found next to other such genes as are its paralogs from the Suf or Isc systems.
