CC  This model represents a clade of acetylornithine deacetylases from proteobacteria.  This enzyme is the final step of the "acetylated" ornithine biosynthesis pathway.  The enzyme is closely related to dapE, succinyl-diaminopimelate desuccinylase, and outside of this clade annotation is very inaccurate as to which function should be ascribed to genes.
