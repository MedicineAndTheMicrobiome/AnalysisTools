CC  This small protein, previously designated YfiD in E. coli, is closely homologous to pyruvate formate_lyase (PFL) in a region surrounding the stable glycyl radical that is prepared by the action of pyruvate formate-lyase activase, a radical SAM enzyme. When damage at the site of this radical breaks the main chain of PFL, this protein acts as a spare part that reintroduces the needed stable glycyl radical. Cutoffs for this model are set to exclude a set of closely related phage proteins that appear to have a corresponding function.
