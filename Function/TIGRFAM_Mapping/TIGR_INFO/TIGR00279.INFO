CC  This model finds the archaeal and eukaryotic forms of ribosomal protein L10. The protein is encoded by multiple loci in some eukaryotes and has been assigned a number of extra-ribosomal functions, some of which will require re-evaluation in the context of identification as a ribosomal protein.
CC  L10.e is distantly related to eubacterial ribosomal protein L16.
