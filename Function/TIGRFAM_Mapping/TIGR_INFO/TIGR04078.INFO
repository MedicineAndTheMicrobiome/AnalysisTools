TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  Members of this radical SAM protein family for peptide modification occur only in the context of members of family TIGR04077, which average about 50 amino acids in length. In Bacillus subtilis, this protein (YydG) appears to act on its cognate target peptide (YydF) prior to its export, and result in the creation of a signaling molecule that induces the LiaRS two-component system.
