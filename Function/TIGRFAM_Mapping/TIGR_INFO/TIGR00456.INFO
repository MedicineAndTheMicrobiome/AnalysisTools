CC  This HMM recognizes arginyl-tRNA synthetase in every completed genome to date. An interesting feature of the alignment of all arginyl-tRNA synthetases is a fairly deep split between two families. One family includes archaeal, eukaryotic and organellar, spirochete, E. coli, and Synechocystis sp. The second, sharing a deletion of about 25 residues in the central region relative to the first, includes Bacillus subtilis, Aquifex aeolicus, the Mycoplasmas and Mycobacteria, and the Gram-negative bacterium Helicobacter pylori.
