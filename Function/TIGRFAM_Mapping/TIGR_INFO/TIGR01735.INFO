CC  This HMM represents a single-molecule form of phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine synthase, also called FGAM synthase, an enzyme of purine de novo biosynthesis. This form is found mostly in eukaryotes and Proteobacteria. In Bacillus subtilis PurL (FGAM synthase II) and PurQ (FGAM synthase I), homologous to different parts of this model, perform the equivalent function; the unrelated small protein PurS is also required and may be a third subunit.
