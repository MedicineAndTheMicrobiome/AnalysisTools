CC  This protein is part of a large group of proteins involved in conjugative transfer of plasmid DNA, specifically the F-type system.  This protein has been predicted to contain a thioredoxin fold and has been shown to be localized to the periplasm [1].  Unlike the related protein TrbB (TIGR02738), TraF does not contain a conserved pair of cysteines and has been shown not to function as a thiol disulfide isomerase by complementation of an Ecoli DsbA defect [2].  The protein is believed to be involved in pilin assembly [3].  Even more closely related than TrbB is a clade of genes (TIGR02740) which do contain the CXXC motif, but it is unclear whether these genes are involved in type-F conjugation systems per se.
