CC  This HMM subfamily is comprised of gamma proteobacteria whose proteins function as L-rhamnosyltransferases in the synthesis of their respective surface polysaccharides.
CC  Rhamnolipids are glycolipids containing mono- or di- L-rhamnose molecules. Rhamnolipid synthesis occurs by sequential glycosyltransferase reactions involving two distinct rhamnosyltransferase enzymes. In P.aeruginosa, the synthesis of mono-rhamnolipids is catalyzed by rhamnosyltransferase 1, and proceeds by a glycosyltransfer reaction catalyzed by rhamnosyltransferase 2 to yield di-rhamnolipids [1].
