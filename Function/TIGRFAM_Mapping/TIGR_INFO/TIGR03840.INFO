CC  Members of this family are thiopurine S-methyltransferase from a branch in which at least some member proteins can perform selenium methylation as a means to detoxify selenium, or perform a related  detoxification of tellurium. Note that the EC number definition does not specify a particular thiopurine, but rather represents a class of activity.
