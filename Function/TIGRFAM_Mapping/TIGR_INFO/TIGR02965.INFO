CC  Members of the protein family are the molybdopterin-containing large subunit (or, in, eukaryotes, the molybdopterin-binding domain) of xanthine dehydrogenase, and enzyme that reduces the purine pool by catabolizing xanthine to urate. This model is based primarily on bacterial sequences; it does not manage to include all eukaryotic xanthine dehydrogenases and thereby discriminate them from the closely related enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase.
