CC  This DNA-binding domain family includes AbrB, a transition state regulator in Bacillus subtilis, whose DNA-binding domain structure in solution was determined by NMR. The domain binds DNA as a dimer in what is termed a looped-hinge helix fold. Some members of the family have two copies of the domain in tandem. The domain is found usually at the N-terminus of a small protein. This model excludes members of family TIGR02609.
