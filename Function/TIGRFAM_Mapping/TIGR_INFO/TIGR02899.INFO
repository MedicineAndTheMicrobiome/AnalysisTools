CC  SafA (YrbB) (SafA) of Bacillus subtilis is a protein found at the interface of the spore cortex and spore coat, and is dependent on SpoVID for its localization. This model is based on the N-terminal LysM (lysin motif) domain (see PFAM model PF01476) of SafA and, from several other spore-forming species, the protein with the most similar N-terminal region. However, this set of proteins differs greatly in C-terminal of the LysM domaim; blocks of 12-residue and 13-residue repeats are found in the Bacillus cereus group, tandem LysM domains in Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis MB4, etc.  
CC  in which one of which is found in most examples of endospore-forming bacteria. Because lysin motifs are repeated in many proteins, this model is built as a single-hit (-g option, hmms style) model.
