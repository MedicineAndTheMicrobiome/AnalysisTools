CC  This HMM represents the C-terminal of TonB and is homologs. TonB is an energy-transducer for TonB-dependent receptors of Gram-negative bacteria. Most members are designated as TonB or TonB-related proteins, but a few represent the paralogous TolA protein. Several bacteria have up to four TonB paralogs. In nearly every case, a proline-rich repetive region is found N-terminal to this domain; these low-complexity regions are highly divergent and cannot readily be aligned. The region is suggested to help span the periplasm.
