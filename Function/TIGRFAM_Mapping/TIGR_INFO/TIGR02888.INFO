CC  Members of this family belong to the broader family of PRC-barrel domain proteins (see Pfam model PF05239), but are found only in endospore-forming bacteria of the Firmicutes lineage. Most such species have exactly two members of this family and all have at least one; the function is unknown. One of two members from Bacillus subtilis, YmxH, is strongly induced by the mother cell-specific sigma-E factor.
