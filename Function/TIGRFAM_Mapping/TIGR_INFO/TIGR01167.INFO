CC  This model describes the LPXTG motif-containing region found at the C-terminus of many surface proteins of Streptococcus and Streptomyces species. Cleavage between the Thr and Gly by sortase or a related enzyme leads to covalent anchoring at the new C-terminal Thr to the cell wall.  Hits that do not lie at the C-terminus or are not found in Gram-positive bacteria are probably false-positive.
CC  A common feature of this proteins containing this domain appears to be a high proportion of charged and zwitterionic residues immediatedly upstream of the LPXTG motif. This model differs from other descriptions of the LPXTG region by including a portion of that upstream charged region.
