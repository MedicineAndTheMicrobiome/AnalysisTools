CC  Glycine reductase is a complex with two selenoprotein subunits, A and B.  This HMM represents the glycine reductase selenoprotein B. Closely related to it, but excluded from this model, are selenoprotein B subunits of betaine reductase and sarcosine reductase. All contain selenocysteine incorporated during translation at a specific UGA codon.
