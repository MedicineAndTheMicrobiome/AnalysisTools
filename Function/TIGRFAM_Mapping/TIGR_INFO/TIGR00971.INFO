CC  This HMM describes binding proteins functionally associated with the sulfate ABC transporter. In the model bacterium E. coli, two different members work with the same transporter; mutation analysis says each enables the uptake of both sulfate and thiosulfate. In many species, a single binding protein is found, and may be referred to in general terms as a sulfate ABC transporter sulfate-binding protein.
