CC  This HMM describes a domain (or in most cases the full length) of archaeal surface proteins that are putative targets for C-terminal processing by archaeosortase A (TIGR04125). Most members of this family belong to proteins encoded by tandem genes in the genus Methanosarcina. The putative processing signal, PGF-CTERM (TIGR04126), included within the domain definition, takes a variant form, with consensus motif PAF instead of PGF. We suggest the name MAST domain: Methanosarcina Archaeosortase-Sorted Tandem gene family domain.
