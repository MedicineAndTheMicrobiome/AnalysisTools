CC  This HMM represents the reductase which acts reduces the geranylgeranyl group to the phytyl group in the side chain of chlorophyll.  It is unclear whether the enzyme has a preference for acting before or after the attachment of the side chain to chlorophyllide a by chlorophyll synthase.  This clade is restricted to plants and cyanobacteria to separate it from the homologues which act in the biosynthesis of bacteriochlorophyll.
