CC  Involved in threonine biosynthesis it catalyses the reaction O-PHOSPHO-L-HOMOSERINE + H(2)O = L-THREONINE + ORTHOPHOSPHATE using pyridoxal phosphate as a cofactor. the enzyme is distantly related to the serine/threonine dehydratases which are also pyridoxal-phosphate dependent enzymes. the pyridoxal-phosphate binding site is a Lys (K) residues present at residue 70 of the model.
