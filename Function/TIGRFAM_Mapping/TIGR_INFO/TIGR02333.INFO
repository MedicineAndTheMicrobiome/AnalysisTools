CC  Members of this family appear in an operon for the degradation of propionyl-CoA via 2-methylcitrate. This family is homologous to aconitases A and B and appears to act the part as 2-methylisocitrate dehydratase, the enzyme after PrpD and before PrpB. In Escherichia coli, which lacks a member of this family, 2-methylisocitrate dehydratase activity was traced to aconitase B (TIGR00117) (PMID:12473114).

RT  The acnD genes of Shewenella oneidensis and Vibrio cholerae encode a new Fe/S-dependent 2-methylcitrate dehydratase enzyme that requires prpF function in vivo.
