CC  This uncharacterized protein family includes YqeC from Escherichia coli. A phylogenetic profiling analysis shows correlation with SelD, the selenium donor protein, even in species where SelD contributes to neither selenocysteine nor selenouridine biosynthesis. Instead, this family, and families TIGR03309 and TIGR03310 appear to mark selenium-dependent molybdenum hydroxylase maturation systems.
