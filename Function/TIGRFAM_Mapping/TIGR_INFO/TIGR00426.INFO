TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  Members of the subfamily recognized by this model include competence protein ComEA and closely related proteins from a number of species that exhibit competence for transformation by exongenous DNA, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Bacillus subtilis, Neisseria meningitidis, and Haemophilus influenzae. This model represents a region of two tandem copies of a helix-hairpin-helix domain (PF00633), each about 30 residues in length. Limited sequence similarity can be found among some members of this family N-terminal to the region covered by this model.
