CC  The protein PfaB is part of four gene locus, similar to polyketide biosynthesis systems, responsible for omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis in several high pressure and/or cold-adapted bacteria. The fairly permissive trusted cutoff set for this model allows detection of homologs encoded near homologs to other proteins of the locus: PfaA, PfaC, and/or PfaD. The likely role in every case is either polyunsaturated fatty acid or polyketide biosynthesis.
