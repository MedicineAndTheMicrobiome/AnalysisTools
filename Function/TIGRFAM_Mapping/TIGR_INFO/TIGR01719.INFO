CC  This model represents a clade of mainly eucaryotic uridine phosphorylases.  Genes from human [1] and mouse [2] have been characterized.  This enzyme is a member of the PHP/UDP subfamily (PF01048) and is closely related to the bacterial uridine (TIGR01718) and inosine (TIGR00107) phosphorylase equivalogs.  In addition to the eukaryotes, a gene from Mycobacterium leprae is included in this equivalog and may have resulted from lateral gene transfer.
