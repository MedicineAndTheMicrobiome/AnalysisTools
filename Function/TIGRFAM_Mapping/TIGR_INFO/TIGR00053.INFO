CC  This HMM represents a cluster of eubacterial proteins and a cluster of archaeal proteins, all of which are uncharacterized, from 85 to 102 residues in length, and similar in sequence. These include YafQ, a ribosome-associated endoribonuclease that serves as part of a toxin-antitoxin system, for which DinJ is the antidote component.

RT  Bacterial toxin YafQ is an endoribonuclease that associates with the ribosome and blocks translation elongation through sequence-specific and frame-dependent mRNA cleavage.
