CC  Members of this family are the enzyme ADP-ribosyl-[dinitrogen reductase] hydrolase (EC 3.2.2.24), better known as Dinitrogenase Reductase Activating Glycohydrolase, DRAG. This enzyme reverses a regulatory inactivation of dinitrogen reductase caused by the action of NAD(+)--dinitrogen-reductase ADP-D-ribosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.37) (DRAT). This enzyme is restricted to nitrogen-fixing bacteria and belongs to the larger family of ADP-ribosylglycohydrolases described by Pfam model PF03747.
