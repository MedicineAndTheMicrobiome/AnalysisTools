EN  copper transport repressor, CopY/TcrY family
TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  This family includes metal-fist type transcriptional repressors of copper transport systems such as copYZAB of Enterococcus hirae and tcrYAZB (transferble copper resistance) of an Enterocuccus faecium plasmid. High levels of copper can displace zinc and prevent binding by the repressor, activating efflux by copper resistance transporters. The most closely related proteins excluded by this model are antibiotic resistance regulators including the methicillin resistance regulatory protein MecI.
