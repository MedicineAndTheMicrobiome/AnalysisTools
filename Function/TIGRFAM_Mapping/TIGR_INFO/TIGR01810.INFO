CC  Choline dehydrogenase catalyzes the conversion of exogenously supplied choline into the intermediate glycine betaine aldehyde, as part of a two-step oxidative reaction leading to the formation of osmoprotectant betaine. This enzymatic system can be found in both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
CC  As in Escherichia coli [1], Staphylococcus xylosus [2], and Sinorhizobium meliloti [3], this enzyme is found associated in a transciptionally co-induced gene cluster with betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase, the second catalytic enzyme in this reaction. Other gram-positive organisms have been shown to employ a different enzymatic system, utlizing a soluable choline oxidase or type III alcohol dehydrogenase instead of choline dehydrogenase [4].
CC  This enzyme is a member of the GMC oxidoreductase family (PF00732 and PF05199), sharing a common evoluntionary origin and enzymatic reaction with alcohol dehydrogenase [5]. Outgrouping from this model, Caulobacter crescentus shares sequence homology with choline dehydrogenase, yet other genes participating in this enzymatic reaction have not currently been identified.
