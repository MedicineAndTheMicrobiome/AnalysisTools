CC  MreC (murein formation C) is involved in the rod shape determination in E. coli, and more generally in cell shape determination of bacteria whether or not they are rod-shaped. Cells defective in MreC are round. Species with MreC include many of the Proteobacteria, Gram-positives, and spirochetes.
