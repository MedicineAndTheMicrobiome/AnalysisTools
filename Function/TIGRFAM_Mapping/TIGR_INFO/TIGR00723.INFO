CC  A number of Fe-S cluster-containing hydro-lyases share a conserved motif, including argininosuccinate lyase, adenylosuccinate lyase, aspartase, class I fumarate hydratase (fumarase), and tartrate dehydratase (see PROSITE:PDOC00147). This model represents a subset of closely related proteins or modules, including the E. coli tartrate dehydratase beta chain and the C-terminal region of the class I fumarase (where the N-terminal region is homologous to the tartrate dehydratase alpha chain). The activity of archaeal proteins in this subfamily has not been established.
