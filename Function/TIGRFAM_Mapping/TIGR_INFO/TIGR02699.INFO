CC  The prototypical member of this archaeal protein family is AF1518 from Archaeoglobus fulgidus. This homodimer with two non-covalently bound FMN cofactors can receive electrons from ferredoxin, but not from a number of other electron donors such as NADH or rubredoxin. It can then donate electrons to various reductases.
