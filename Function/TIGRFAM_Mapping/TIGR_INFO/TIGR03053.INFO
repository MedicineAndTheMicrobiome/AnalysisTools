CC  Members of this protein family are PsaM, which is subunit XII of the photosystem I reaction center.  This protein is found in both the Cyanobacteria and the chloroplasts of plants, but is absent from non-oxygenic photosynthetic bacteria such as Rhodobacter sphaeroides. Species that contain photosystem I also contain photosystem II, which splits water and releases molecular oxygen. The seed alignment for this model includes sequences from Pfam model PF07465 and additional sequences, as from Prochlorococcus.
