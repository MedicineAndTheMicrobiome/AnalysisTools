CC  This HMM represents the YbaK family, bacterial proteins whose full length sequence is homologous to an insertion domain in proline--tRNA ligases. The domain deacylates mischarged tRNAs. The YbaK protein of Haemophilus influenzae (HI1434) likewise deacylates Ala-tRNA(Pro), but not the correctly charged Pro-tRNA(Pro).  A crystallographic study of HI1434 suggests a nucleotide binding function. Previously, a member of this family was described as EbsC and was thought to be involved in cell wall metabolism.
