CC  Members of this protein family resemble the domain of unknown function DUF1858 described by PF08984, but all members contain an apparent redox-active disulfide. In at least one member protein, a cysteine in the CXXC motif is substituted by a selenocysteine. Most member proteins consist of this domain only, but a few members are fused to or adjacent to members of the hybrid-cluster (prismane) family or the nitrite/sulfite reductase family.
