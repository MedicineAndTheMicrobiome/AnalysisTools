CC  In many molybdopterin-containing enzymes, including nitrate reductase and dimethylsulfoxide reductase, the cofactor is molybdopterin-guanine dinucleotide. The family described here contains MobA, molybdenum cofactor guanylyltransferase, from the Proteobacteria only. MobA can reconstitute molybdopterin-guanine dinucleotide biosynthesis without the product of the neighboring gene MobB. The probable MobA proteins of other lineages differ sufficiently that they are not included in scope of this family.
