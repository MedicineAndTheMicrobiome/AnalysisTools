CC  Most phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetases are heterodimeric, with 2 alpha (pheS) and 2 beta (pheT) subunits. This HMM describes the alpha subunit, which shows some similarity to class II aminoacyl-tRNA ligases. Mitochondrial phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase is a single polypeptide chain, active as a monomer, and similar to this chain rather than to the beta chain, but excluded from this model. An interesting feature of the alignment of all sequences captured by this model is a deep split between non-spirochete bacterial examples and all other examples; supporting this split is a relative deletion of about 50 residues in the former set between two motifs well conserved throughout the alignment.
