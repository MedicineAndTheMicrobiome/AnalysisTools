CC  CRISPR is a term for Clustered, Regularly Interspaced Short Palidromic Repeats. A number of protein families appear only in association with these repeats and are designated Cas (CRISPR-Associated) proteins. This HMM represents a minor branch of the Cas2 family of CRISPR-associated endonuclease, whereas most Cas2 proteins are modeled instead by TIGR01573. This form of Cas2 is characteristic for the Ecoli subtype of CRISPR/Cas locus.
