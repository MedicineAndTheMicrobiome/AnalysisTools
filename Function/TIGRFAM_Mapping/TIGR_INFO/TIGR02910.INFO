CC  Members of this protein family include the A subunit, one of three subunits, of the anaerobic sulfite reductase of Salmonella, and close homologs from various Clostridum species, where the three-gene neighborhood is preserved. Two such gene clusters are found in Clostridium perfringens, but it may be that these sets of genes correspond to the distinct assimilatory and dissimilatory forms as seen in Clostridium pasteurianum. Note that any one of these enzymes may have secondary substates such as NH2OH, SeO3(2-), and SO3(2-). Heterologous expression of the anaerobic sulfite reductase of Salmonella confers on Escherichia coli the ability to produce hydrogen sulfide gas from sulfite.
