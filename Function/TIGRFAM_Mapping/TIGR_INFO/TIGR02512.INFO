CC  This model describes iron-only hydrogenases of anaerobic and microaerophilic bacteria and protozoa. This model is narrower, and covers a longer stretch of sequence, than Pfam model PF02906.  This family represents a division among families that belong to PF02906, which also includes proteins such as nuclear prelamin A recognition factor in animals. Note that this family shows some heterogeneity in terms of periplasmic, cytosolic, or hydrogenosome location, NAD or NADP dependence, and overal protein protein length.
