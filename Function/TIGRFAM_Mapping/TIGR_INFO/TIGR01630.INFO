CC  This HMM represents the C-terminal region of a set of phage proteins typically about 400-500 amino acids in length, although some members are considerably shorter. An article on Methanobacterium phage Psi-M2 (PMID:9791169) calls the member from that phage, ORF9, a putative large terminase subunit, and ORF8 a candidate terminase small subunit. Most proteins in this family have an apparent P-loop nucleotide-binding sequence toward the N-terminus.
