CC  This subfamily of drug efflux proteins, a part of the major faciliator family, is predicted to have 14 potential membrane-spanning regions. Members with known activities include EmrB (multiple drug resistance efflux pump) in E. coli, FarB (antibacterial fatty acid resistance) in Neisseria gonorrhoeae, TcmA (tetracenomycin C resistance) in Streptomyces glaucescens, etc. In most cases, the efflux pump is described as having a second component encoded in the same operon, such as EmrA of E. coli.
