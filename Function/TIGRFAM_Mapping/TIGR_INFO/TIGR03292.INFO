CC  PhnH is a component of the C-P lyase system (GenProp0232) for the catabolism of phosphonate compounds.  The specific function of this component is unknown.  This model is based on Pfam model PF05845.2, and has been broadened to include sequences missed by that model which are clearly true positive hits based on genome context.
