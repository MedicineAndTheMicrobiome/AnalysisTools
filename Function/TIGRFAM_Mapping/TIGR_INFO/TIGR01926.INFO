CC  This protein family with length of about 200 amino acids. One member, from Myxococcus xanthus, is a selenoprotein, with an otherwise conserved Cys replaced by Sec. This family is drawn narrowly enough to suggest that These proteins contain a domain described by TIGR00778, with a CxxCxxxHxxxxxxxG motif. Some members of that family are known to act as peroxidases or correlate with resistance to oxidative stress.
