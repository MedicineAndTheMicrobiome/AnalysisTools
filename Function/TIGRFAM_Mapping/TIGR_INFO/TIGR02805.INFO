CC  Members of this protein family appear to be the ExbB protein of an ExbBD proton-transporting membrane complex that, by means of TonB, energizes transport by TonB-dependent receptors. Note that this family represents one of at least two distinct groups TolQ homologs designated ExbB - see also TIGR02797. Each group associates with a distinct group of ExbD proteins, and a single species may have two ExbB/ExbD/TonB systems.
