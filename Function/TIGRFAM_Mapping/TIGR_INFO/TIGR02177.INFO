CC  A number of anaerobic and microaerophilic species lack pyruvate dehydrogenase and have instead a four subunit, oxygen-sensitive pyruvate oxidoreductase, with either ferredoxins or flavodoxins used as the acceptor.
CC  Several related four-subunit enzymes may exist in the same species. This model describes a subfamily of beta subunits, representing mostly pyruvate and 2-ketoisovalerate specific enzymes.
