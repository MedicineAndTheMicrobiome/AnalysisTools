TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  All proteins in this family for which functions are known are cyclin dependent protein kinases that are components of TFIIH, a complex that is involved in nucleotide excision repair and transcription initiation.  Also known as MAT1 (menage a trois 1).  This family is based on the phylogenomic analysis of JA Eisen (1999, Ph.D. Thesis, Stanford University).
