CC  CgtA (see model TIGR02729) is a broadly conserved member of the obg family of GTPases associated with ribosome maturation. This model represents a unique C-terminal domain found in some but not all sequences of CgtA. This region is preceded, and may be followed, by a region of low-complexity sequence.
