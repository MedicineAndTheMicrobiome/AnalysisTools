CC  Members of this family of short peptides are precursors to thiolactone (unless Cys is replaced by Ser) cyclic autoinducer peptides, used in quorum-sensing systems in Gram-positive bacteria. The best characterized is the AgrD precursor, processed by the AgrB protein. Nearby proteins regularly encountered include a histidine kinase and a response regulator. This model is related to PF05931 but is newer and currently broader in scope.
