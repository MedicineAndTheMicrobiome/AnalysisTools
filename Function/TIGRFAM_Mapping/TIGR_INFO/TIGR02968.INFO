CC  In E. coli and many other bacteria, two small, hydrophobic, mutually homologous subunits of succinate dehydrogenase, a TCA cycle enzyme, are SdhC and SdhD. This family is the SdhD, the hydrophobic membrane anchor protein. SdhC is apocytochrome b558, which also plays a role in anchoring the complex.
