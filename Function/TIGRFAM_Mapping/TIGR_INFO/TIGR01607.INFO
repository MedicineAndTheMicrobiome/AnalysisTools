CC  This model represents a paralogous family of genes in Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium yoelii [1,2] which are closely related to various phospholipases and lysophospholipases of plants as well as generally being related to the alpha/beta-fold superfamily of hydrolases.
CC  These genes are preferentially located in the subtelomeric regions of the chromosomes of both P. falciparum and P. yoelii [1,2].
