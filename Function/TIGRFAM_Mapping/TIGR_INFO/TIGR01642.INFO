CC  These splicing factors consist of an N-terminal arginine-rich low complexity domain followed by three tandem RNA recognition motifs (PF00076).  The well-characterized members of this family are auxilliary components of the U2 small nuclear ribonuclearprotein splicing factor (U2AF).  These proteins are closely related to the CC1-like subfamily of splicing factors (TIGR01622).
CC  Members of this subfamily are found in plants, metazoa and fungi.
