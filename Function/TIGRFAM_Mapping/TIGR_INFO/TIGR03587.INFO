CC  Members of this small clade are methyltransferases of the PF08241 family and are observed  within operons for the biosynthesis of pseudaminic acid, a component of exopolysaccharide and flagellin glycosyl modifications [1].   Notable among these genomes is Pseudomonas fluorescens PfO-1.  Possibly one of the two hydroxyl groups of pseudaminic acid, at positions 4 and 8 is converted to a methoxy group by this enzyme
