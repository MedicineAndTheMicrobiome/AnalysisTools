CC  The yeast protein called old yellow enzyme and FadH from Escherichia coli (2,4-dienoyl CoA reductase) are enzymes with 4Fe-4S, FMN, and FAD prosthetic groups, and interact with NADPH as well as substrate. Members of this related protein family occur in the vicinity of the putative mycofactocin biosynthesis operon in a number of Actinobacteria such as Frankia sp. and Rhodococcus sp., in Pelotomaculum thermopropionicum SI (Firmicutes), and in  Geobacter uraniireducens Rf4 (Deltaproteobacteria). The function of this oxidoreductase is unknown.
