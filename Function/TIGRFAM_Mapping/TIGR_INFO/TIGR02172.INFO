CC  This model describes a paralogous family of five proteins, likely to be enzymes, in the rumen bacterium Fibrobacter succinogenes S85. Members show homology to proteins described by PFAM model PF01636, a phosphotransferase enzyme family associated with resistance to aminoglycoside antibiotics. However, members of this family score below the current trusted and noise cutoffs for PF01636.
