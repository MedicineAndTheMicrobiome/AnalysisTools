CC  This HMM describes a family of proteins from the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, several of which have been shown to be expressed specifically in the ring stage as well as the rident parasite Plasmodium yoelii. A homolog from Plasmodium chabaudi was localized to the parasitophorous vacuole membrane. Members have an initial hydrophobic, Phe/Tyr-rich stretch long enough to span the membrane, a highly charged region rich in Lys, a second putative transmembrane region, and a second highly charged, low complexity sequence region. Some members have up to 100 residues of additional C-terminal sequence. 
CC  These genes have been shown to be found in the sub-telomeric regions of both P. falciparum and P. yoelii chromosomes [3,4]
