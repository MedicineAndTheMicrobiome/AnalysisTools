CC  This domain model describes a subclass with family TIGR02595 of PEP-CTERM protein sorting signals associated with bacterial exosortases. This subclass is restricted to Cyanobacteria, including the genera Cyanothece, Nostoc, Trichodesmium, Lyngbya, Arthospira, etc. This PEP-CTERM subclass features strongly conserved residues within the transmembrane region, including a Gx4GxG motif. Model TIGR03763 describes a corresponding cyanobacterial form of exosortase found in most species with this domain.
