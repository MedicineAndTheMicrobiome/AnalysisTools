CC  This enzyme, involved in the assimilation of inorganic sulfate, is designated cysH in Bacteria and MET16 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Synonyms include phosphoadenosine phosphosulfate reductase, PAPS reductase, and PAPS reductase, thioredoxin-dependent. In a reaction requiring reduced thioredoxin and NADPH, it converts 3(prime)-phosphoadenylylsulfate (PAPS) to sulfite and adenosine 3(prime),5(prime) diphosphate (PAP). A related family of plant enzymes, scoring below the trusted cutoff, differs in having a thioredoxin-like C-terminal domain, not requiring thioredoxin, and in having a preference for 5(prime)-adenylylsulfate (APS) over PAPS.
