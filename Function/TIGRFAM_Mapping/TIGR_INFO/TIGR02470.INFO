CC  This model represents sucrose synthase, an enzyme that, despite its name, generally uses rather produces sucrose. Sucrose plus UDP (or ADP) becomes D-fructose plus UDP-glucose (or ADP-glucose), which is then available for cell wall (or starch) biosynthesis. The enzyme is homologous to sucrose phosphate synthase, which catalyzes the penultimate step in sucrose synthesis. Sucrose synthase is found, so far, exclusively in plants and cyanobacteria.
