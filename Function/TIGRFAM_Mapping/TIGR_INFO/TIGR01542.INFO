EN  phage portal protein, putative, A118 family
TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  This HMM represents a family of phage minor structural proteins. The protein is suggested to be the head-tail connector, or portal protein, on the basis of its position in the phage gene order, its presence in mature phage, its size, and its conservation across a number of complete genomes of tailed phage that lack other candidate portal proteins. Several other known portal protein families lack clear homology to this family and to each other.
