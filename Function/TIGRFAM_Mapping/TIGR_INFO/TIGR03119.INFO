CC  Members of this protein family are the FhcD protein of tetrahydromethanopterin (H4MPT)-dependent C-1 carrier metabolism. In the archaea, FhcD is designated formylmethanofuran--tetrahydromethanopterin N-formyltransferase, while in bacteria it is commonly designated as formyltransferase/hydrolase complex subunit D. FhcD is essential for one-carbon metabolism in at least three groups of prokaryotes: methanogenic archaea, sulfate-reducing archaea, and methylotrophic bacteria.
