CC  5-dehydro-4-deoxyglucarate dehydratase not only catalyzes the dehydration of the substrate (diol to ketone + water), but causes the decarboxylation of the intermediate product to yield 2-oxoglutarate semialdehyde (2,5-dioxopentanoate).  The gene for the enzyme is usually observed in the vicinity of transporters and dehydratases handling D-galactarate and D-gluconate as well as aldehyde dehydrogenases which convert the product to alpha-ketoglutarate.
