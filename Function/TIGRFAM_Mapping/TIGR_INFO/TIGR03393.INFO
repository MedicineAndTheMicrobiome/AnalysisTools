CC  A family of closely related, thiamine pyrophosphate-dependent enzymes includes indolepyruvate decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.74), phenylpyruvate decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.43), pyruvate decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.1), branched-chain alpha-ketoacid decarboxylase, etc.. Members of this group of homologs may overlap in specificity. Within the larger family, this model represents a clade of bacterial indolepyruvate decarboxylases, part of a pathway for biosynthesis of the plant hormone indole-3-acetic acid. Typically, these species interact with plants, as pathogens or as beneficial, root-associated bacteria.
