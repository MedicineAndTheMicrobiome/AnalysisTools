CC  Members of this family are DNA primase, a ubiquitous bacteria protein. Most members of this family contain nearly two hundred additional residues C-terminal to the region represented here, but conservation between species is poor and the C-terminal region was not included in the seed alignment.
CC  This protein contains a CHC2 zinc finger (Pfam:PF01807) and a Toprim domain (Pfam:PF01751).
