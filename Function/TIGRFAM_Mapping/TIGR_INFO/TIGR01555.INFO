CC  This HMM describes an uncharacterized family of proteins found in prophage regions of a number of bacterial genomes, including Haemophilus influenzae, Xylella fastidiosa, Salmonella typhi, and Enterococcus faecalis. Distantly related proteins can be found in the prophage-bearing plasmids of Borrelia burgdorferi.
