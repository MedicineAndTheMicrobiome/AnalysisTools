CC  Members of this family are photoactive yellow protein, a cytosolic, 14-kDa light-sensing protein which has a 4-hydroxycinnamyl (p-coumaric acid) chromophore covalently linked to a Cys residue. The enzyme 4-coumarate--CoA ligase as described by TIGR02372 is required for its biosynthesis.  The modified Cys is in a PAS (PF00989) domain, frequently found in signal transducing proteins. Members are known in alpha and gamma Proteobacteria that include Rhodobacter capsulatus, Halorhodospira halophila, Rhodospirillum centenum, etc.
