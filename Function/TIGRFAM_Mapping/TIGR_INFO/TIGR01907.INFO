CC  CRISPR is a term for Clustered, Regularly Interspaced Short Palidromic Repeats. A number of protein families appear only in association with these repeats and are designated Cas (CRISPR-Associated) proteins. This HMM family, represented by CT1974 from Chlorobium tepidum, is found in the Ecoli subtype of CRISPR/Cas regions and is designated Cse3 (CRISPR/Cas Subtype Ecoli protein 3).
CC  The representative of this family from Thermus thermophilus HB8 (TTHB192) has been crystallized [2] and found to have a structure consisting of two domains with opposing parallel beta-sheets known as a beta-sheet platform.  This structure is similar to those found in the Sex-lethal protein and poly(A)-binding protein.  This structure is consistent with an RNA-binding function.
