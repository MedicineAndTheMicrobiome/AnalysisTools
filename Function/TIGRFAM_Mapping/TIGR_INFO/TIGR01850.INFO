CC  This HMM represents the more common of two related families of N-acetyl-gamma-glutamyl-phosphate reductase, an enzyme catalyzing the third step or Arg biosynthesis from Glu. The two families differ by phylogeny, similarity clustering, and the gap architecture in a multiple sequence alignment. Bacterial members of this family tend to be found within Arg biosynthesis operons.
