CC  This family is a member of the RpiB/LacA/LacB subfamily (TIGR00689) but lies outside the RpiB equivalog (TIGR01120) which is also a member of that subfamily.  Ribose 5-phosphate isomerase is an essential enzyme of the pentose phosphate pathway; a pathway that appears to be present in the actinobacteria.  The only candidates for ribose 5-phosphate isomerase in the Actinobacteria are members of this family.
