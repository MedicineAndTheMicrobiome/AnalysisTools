CC  CRISPR is a term for Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palidromic Repeats. A number of protein families appear only in association with these repeats and are designated Cas (CRISPR associated) proteins. Members of this cas gene family are found in the mtube subtype of CRISPR/cas locus and designated Csm4, for CRISPR/cas Subtype Mtube, protein 4.
