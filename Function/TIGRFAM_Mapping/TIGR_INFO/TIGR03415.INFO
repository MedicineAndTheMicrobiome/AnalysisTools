CC  Members of this protein family are the ATP-binding subunit of a three-protein transporter. This family belongs, more broadly, to the family of proline and glycine-betaine transporters, but members have been identified by direct characterization and by bioinformatic means as choline transporters. Many species have several closely-related members of this family, probably with variable abilities to act additionally on related quaternary amines.
