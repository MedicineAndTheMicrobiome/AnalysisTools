CC  This apparently ubiquitous enzyme is found in bacterial, mammalian and plant sources. The enzyme catalyzes the reaction: GLYCINE + LIPOYLPROTEIN = S-AMINOMETHYL-DIHYDROLIPOYLPROTEIN + CO2. It is part of the glycine decarboxylase multienzyme complex (GDC) consisting of four proteins P, H, L and T.  Active site in E.coli is located as the (K) residues at position 713 of the SEED alignment.
