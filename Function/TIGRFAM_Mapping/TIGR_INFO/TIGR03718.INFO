CC  Rfam model RF00080 describes a structured RNA element called the yybP-ykoY leader, or SraF, which may precede one or several genes in a genome. Members of this highly hydrophobic protein family often are preceded by a yybP-ykoY leader, which may serve as a riboswitch. From the larger group of TerC homologs (PF03741), this subfamily contains TerC itself from Alcaligenes sp. plasmid IncHI2 pMER610 and from Proteus mirabilis. It also contains the alkaline-inducible E. coli protein Alx, which unlike the two TerC examples is preceded by a yybP-ykoY leader.
