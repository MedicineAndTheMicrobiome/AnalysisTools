CC  Members of this family from B. subtilis, Aquifex aeolicus, and Synechocystis PCC6803 (and related taxa) lack the C-terminal third of the sequence. The sole homolog from Archaeoglobus fulgidus lacks the N-terminal 50 residues (as reported) and is otherwise atypical of the rest of the family.  This model excludes the C-terminal extension.
