CC  In many bacteria, the sole member of this protein family is arginine N-succinyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.109), the AstA protein of the arginine succinyltransferase (ast) pathway. However, in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and several other species, a tandem gene pair encodes alpha and beta subunits of a heterodimer that is designated arginine and ornithine succinyltransferase (AOST).
