CC  This model represents a narrow clade of acyltransferases, nearly all of which transfer a lauroyl group to KDO2-lipid IV-A, a lipid A precursor; these proteins are termed lipid A biosynthesis lauroyl acyltransferase, HtrB. An exception is a closely related paralog of E. coli HtrB, LpxP, which acts in cold shock conditions by transferring a palmitoleoyl rather than lauroyl group to the lipid A precursor. Members of this family are homologous to the family of acyltransferases responsible for the next step in lipid A biosynthesis.
