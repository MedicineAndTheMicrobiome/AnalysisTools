CC  This glutaredoxin-like protein family contains the conserved CxxC motif and includes the Clostridium pasteurianum protein YruB which has been cloned from a rubredoxin operon [1].  Somewhat related to NrdH, it is unknown whether this protein actually interacts with glutathione/glutathione reducatase, or, like NrdH, some other reductant system.
