CC  This HMM describes a family of large proteins of herpesvirues. The protein is described variably as tegument protein or phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine synthase (FGAM-synthase). Most of the length of the protein shows homology to eukaryotic FGAM-synthase. Functional characterizations were not verified during construction of this model.
