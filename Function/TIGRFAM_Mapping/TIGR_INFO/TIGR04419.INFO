CC  Members of this protein family are related to radical SAM enzymes HemN (oxygen-independent coproporphyrinogen III oxidase) and HutW (a putative heme utilization enzyme) but lack the signature CxxxCxxC motif for 4Fe-4S binding. Members occur exclusively in Borrelia, which appears to live without iron, as the only radical SAM enzyme homolog in any Borrelia genome. We designate this enzyme PsgB (Pseudo-SAM, Genus Borrelia).
