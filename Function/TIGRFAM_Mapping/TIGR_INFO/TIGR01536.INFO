CC  This HMM describes the glutamine-hydrolysing asparagine synthase. A poorly conserved C-terminal extension was removed from the model. Bacterial members of the family tend to have a long, poorly conserved insert lacking from archaeal and eukaryotic sequences. Multiple isozymes have been demonstrated, such as in Bacillus subtilis. Long-branch members of the phylogenetic tree (which typically were also second or third candidate members from their genomes) were removed from the seed alignment and score below trusted cutoff.
