CC  A Genome Properties metabolic reconstruction for F420 biosynthesis shows that slightly over 10 percent of all prokaryotes with fully sequenced genomes, including about two thirds of the Actinomycetales, make F420. This subfamily within the PPOX family occurs in at least 19 distinct species of F420 producers and is likely to bind F420 rather than FMN.
