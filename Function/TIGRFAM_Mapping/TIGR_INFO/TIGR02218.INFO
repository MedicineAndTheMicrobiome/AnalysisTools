CC  This HMM describes a family of proteins found almost exclusively in phage or in prophage regions of bacterial genomes, including the phage-like Rhodobacter capsulatus gene transfer agent, which packages DNA. An apparent exception is Wolbachia pipientis wMel, a bacterial endosymbiont of the fruit fly, which has several candidate phage-related genes physically separate from obvious prophage regions.
