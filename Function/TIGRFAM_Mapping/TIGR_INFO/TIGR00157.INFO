CC  Members of this protein were designated YjeQ and are now designated RsgA (ribosome small subunit-dependent GTPase A).
CC  The strongest motif in the alignment of these proteins is GXSGVGKS[ST], a classic P-loop for nucleotide binding. This protein has been shown to cleave GTP and remain bound to GDP. A role as a regulator of translation has been suggested.
CC  The Aquifex aeolicus ortholog is split into consecutive open reading frames. Consequently, this model was build in fragment mode (-f option).
