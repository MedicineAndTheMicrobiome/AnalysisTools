CC  This model represents HemN, the oxygen-independent coproporphyrinogen III oxidase that replaces HemF function under anaerobic conditions. Several species, including E. coli, Helicobacter pylori, and Aquifex aeolicus, have both a member of this family and a member of another, closely related family for which there is no evidence of coproporphyrinogen III oxidase activity. Members of this family have a perfectly conserved motif PYRT[SC]YP in a region N-terminal to the region of homology with the related uncharacterized protein.
