CC  Members of this family all are enzymes active as catechol 2,3 dioxygenase (1.13.11.2), although some members have highly significant activity on catechol derivatives such as 3-methylcatechol, 3-chlorocatechol, and 4-chlorocatechol (see Mars, et al.). This enzyme is also called metapyrocatechase, as it performs a meta-cleavage (an extradiol ring cleavage), in contrast to the ortho-cleavage (intradiol ring cleavage)performed by catechol 1,2-dioxygenase (EC 1.13.11.1), also called pyrocatechase.
