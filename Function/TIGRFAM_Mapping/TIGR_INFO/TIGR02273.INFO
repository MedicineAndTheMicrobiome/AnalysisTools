CC  This family consists of the bacterial protein RimM (YfjA, 21K), a 30S ribosomal subunit-binding protein implicated in 16S ribsomal RNA processing. It has been partially characterized in Escherichia coli, is found with other translation-associated genes such as trmD. It is broadly distributed among bacteria, including some minimal genomes such the aphid endosymbiont Buchnera aphidicola. The protein contains a PRC-barrel domain that it shares with other protein families (PF05239) and a unique domain (PF01782). This model describes the full-length protein. A member from Arabidopsis (plant) has additional N-terminal sequence likely to represent a chloroplast transit peptide.
