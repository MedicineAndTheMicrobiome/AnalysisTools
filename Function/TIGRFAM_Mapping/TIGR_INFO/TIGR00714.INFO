CC  This HMM describes the small subunit, Hsc20 (20K heat shock cognate protein) of a pair of proteins Hsc66-Hsc20, related to the DnaK-DnaJ heat shock proteins, which also serve as molecular chaperones. Hsc20, unlike DnaJ, appears not to have chaperone activity on its own, but to act solely as a regulatory subunit for Hsc66 (i.e., to be a co-chaperone). The gene for Hsc20 in E. coli, hscB, is not induced by heat shock.
