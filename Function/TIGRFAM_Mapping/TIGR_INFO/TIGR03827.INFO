CC  Members of this protein family are GNAT family acetyltransferases, based on a seed alignment in which every member is associated with a lysine 2,3-aminomutase family protein, usually as the adjacent gene. This family includes AblB, the enzyme beta-lysine acetyltransferase that completes the two-step synthesis of the osmolyte (compatible solute) N-epsilon-acetyl-beta-lysine; all members of the family may have this function. Note that N-epsilon-acetyl-beta-lysine has been observed only in methanogenic archaea (e.g. Methanosarcina) but that this model, paired with TIGR03820, suggests a much broader distribution.

RT  Lysine-2,3-aminomutase and beta-lysine acetyltransferase genes of methanogenic archaea are salt induced and are essential for the biosynthesis of Nepsilon-acetyl-beta-lysine and growth at high salinity.
