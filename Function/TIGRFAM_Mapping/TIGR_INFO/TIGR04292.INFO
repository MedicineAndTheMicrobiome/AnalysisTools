CC  Members of this protein family are restricted to the Pyrococcus and Thermococcus genera of the archaea. Member proteins have a C-terminal, Cys-containing predicted surface anchor domain, where the Cys may be the site of cleavage and lipid attachment (see domain TIGR04288). Members also contain a region crowded with 10 invariant Cys in 60 residues (see domain TIGR04289), possible ligands to some redox cofactor.
