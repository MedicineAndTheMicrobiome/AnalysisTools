CC  This model represents a paralogous family of Plasmodium yoelii genes preferentially located in the subtelomeric regions of the chromosomes [1].  Members of this family are expressed in both the Sporozoite and Gametozoite life stages [1].  
CC  A single high-scoring gene was identified in the complete genome of P. falciparum [2] as well as a single gene from P. chaboudi from GenBank which were included in the seed.  There are no obvious homologs to these genes in any non-Plasmodium organism.  These observations suggest an expansion of this family in yoelii from a common Plasmodium ancestor gene (present in a single copy in falciparum).
