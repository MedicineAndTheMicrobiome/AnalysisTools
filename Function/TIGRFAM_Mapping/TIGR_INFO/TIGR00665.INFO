CC  This HMM describes the helicase DnaB, a homohexameric protein required for DNA replication. The homohexamer can form a ring around a single strand of DNA near a replication fork. An intein of > 400 residues is found at a conserved location in DnaB of Synechocystis PCC6803, Rhodothermus marinus (both experimentally confirmed), and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The intein removes itself by a self-splicing reaction. The seed alignment contains inteins so that the model built from the seed alignment will model a low cost at common intein insertion sites.
