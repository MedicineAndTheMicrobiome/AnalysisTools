CC  Members of this protein family are designated SpoIIIAC, part of the spoIIIA operon of sporulation genes whose mutant phenotype is linked to sporulation stage III.  Members of this family are encoded by the genome of a species if and only if that species is capable of endospore formation, as in Bacillus subtilis. The molecular function of this small, probable integral membrane protein is unknown.
