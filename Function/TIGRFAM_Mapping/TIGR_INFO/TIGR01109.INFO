CC  This model describes the beta subunits of sodium pump decarboxylases that include oxaloacetate decarboxylase, methylmalonyl-CoA decarboxylase, and glutaconyl-CoA decarboxylase. Beta and gammma-subunits are integral membrane proteins, while alpha is membrane bound. Catalytically, the energy released by the decarboxylation reaction is coupled to the extrusion of Na+ ions across the membrane.
