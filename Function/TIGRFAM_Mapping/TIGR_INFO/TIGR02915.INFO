CC  Members of this protein family share full-length homology with  (but do not include) the acetoacetate metabolism regulatory protein AtoC (see SP|Q06065). These proteins have a Fis family DNA binding sequence (PF02954), a response regulator receiver domain (PF00072), and sigma-54 interaction domain (PF00158).
