CC  Members of this protein family are well conserved subclass of putative ammonimum transporters, belonging to the much broader set of ammonium/methylammonium transporter described by TIGR00836. Species with this transporter tend to be marine bacteria. Partial phylogenetic profiling (PPP) picks a member of this protein family as the single best-scoring protein vs. a reference profile for the marine environment Genome Property for a large number of different query genomes. This finding by PPP suggests that this transporter family represents an important adaptation to the marine environment.
