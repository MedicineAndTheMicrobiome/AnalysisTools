CC  This family consists of remarkably well-conserved proteins from gamma and beta Proteobacteria, heavily skewed towards organisms of marine environments. Its gene neighborhood is not conserved. This family has an OsmC-like N-terminal domain. It shares a YcaO domain, frequently associated with ATP-dependent cyclodehydration for peptide modification. The function is unknown. Fifteen of the first sixteen members of this family are from selenouridine-positive genomes, but this correlation may not be meaningful.
