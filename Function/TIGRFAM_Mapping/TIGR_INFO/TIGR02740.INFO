CC  This protein is related to the F-type conjugation system pilus assembly proteins TraF (TIGR02739)and TrbB (TIGR02738) both of which exhibit a thioredoxin fold [1].  The protein represented by this model has the same length and architecture as TraF, but lacks the CXXC-motif found in TrbB and believed to be responsible for the disulfide isomerase activity of that protein.
