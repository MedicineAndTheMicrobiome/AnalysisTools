CC  The functional assignment to the proteins of this family is contentious. Reference [2] challenges the findings of reference [1], both in interpretation and in enzyme assay results. This protein belongs to the nudix family and shares some sequence identity with E. coli MutT but appears not to be functionally interchangeable with it.
