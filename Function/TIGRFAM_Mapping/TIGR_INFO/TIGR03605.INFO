CC  SagB of Sterptococcus pyogenes participates in the maturation of streptolysin S from a ribosomally produced precursor polypeptide. Chemically similar systems operate on highly diverse sets of bacteriocin precursors in numerous other bacteria. This model describes a domain within SgaB and homologous regions from other proteins, many of which appear to be involved in biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. While some substrates may be intermediates in non-ribosomal peptide syntheses, others are involved in heterocycle-containing bacteriocin biosynthesis, and can be found near SgaC-like (see TIGR03603, cyclodehydratase) and SgaD-like (see TIGR03604, "docking") proteins. Members of this domain family are heterogeneous in length, as many have a partial second copy of the domain represented here. The incomplete second domain scores below the cutoffs to this model in most cases.
