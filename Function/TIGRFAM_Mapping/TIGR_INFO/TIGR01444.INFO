CC  Members of this family are characterized by two well-conserved short regions separated by a variable in both sequence and length. The first of the two regions is found in a large number of proteins outside this subfamily, a number of which have been characterized as methyltransferases. One member of the present family, FkbM, was shown to be required for a specific methylation in the biosynthesis of the immunosuppressant FK506 in Streptomyces strain MA6548.
