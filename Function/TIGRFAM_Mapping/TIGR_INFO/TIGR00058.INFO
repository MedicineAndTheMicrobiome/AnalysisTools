CC  This family includes oxygen carrier proteins of various oligomeric states from the vascular fluid (hemerythrin) and muscle (myohemerythrin) of some marine invertebrates. Each unit binds 2 non-heme Fe using 5 H, one E and one D. One member of this family,from the sandworm Nereis diversicolor, is an unusual (non-metallothionein) cadmium-binding protein. Homologous proteins, excluded from this narrowly defined family, are found in archaea and bacteria (see PF01814).
