CC  This family is found in both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. The functionally characterized members of the family catalyze uptake of either Ni2+ or Co2+ in a proton motive force-dependent process. Topological analyses with the HoxN Ni2+ transporter of Ralstonia eutropha (Alcaligenes eutrophus) suggest that it possesses 8 TMSs with its N- and C-termini in the cytoplasm.
