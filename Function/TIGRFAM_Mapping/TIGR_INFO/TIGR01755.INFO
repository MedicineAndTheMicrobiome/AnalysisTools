CC  This HMM represents a protein, WrbA, related to and slightly larger than flavodoxin. It was just shown, in E. coli and Archaeoglobus fulgidus (and previously for some eukaryotic homologs) to act as fourth type of NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase. In E. coli, this protein was earlier reported to be produced during stationary phase, bind to the trp repressor, and make trp operon repression more efficient. WrbA does not interact with the trp operator by itself. Members are found in species in which homologs of the E. coli trp operon repressor TrpR (SP:P03032) are not detected.
