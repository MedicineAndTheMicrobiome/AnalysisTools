CC  The epsL gene is described as a component of the methanolan exopolysaccharide biosynthesis operon in Methylobacillus sp strain 12S [1], although no other information regarding its possible function is suggested.  Homologs of this gene are found in several other exopolysaccharide operons in a small number of species.  These operons contain a subset of the methanolan operon genes by homology and synteny, including the epsH gene which is proposed to act as an "exosortase" directing proteins with a C-terminal tag (PEP-CTERM) to the exopolysaccharide layer [2].  Each of the genomes in which these genes and epsL are found also encode genes with these C-terminal tags.
