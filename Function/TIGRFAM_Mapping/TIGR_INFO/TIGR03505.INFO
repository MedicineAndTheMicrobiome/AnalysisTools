CC  This region is found at, or about 200 amino acids from, the N-terminus of FimV from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, TspA of Neisseria meningitidis, and related proteins. Disruption of FimV blocks twitching motility from type IV pili; Semmler, et al. suggest a role for this family in peptidoglycan layer remodelling required by type IV fimbrial systems. Most but not all members of this protein family have a C-terminal region recognized by TIGR03504. In between is a highly variable, often repeat-filled region rich in the negatively charged amino acids Asp and Glu.
