CC  Members of this family regularly are encoded between the TrbJ and TrbL proteins essential for P-type conjugal transfer, and therefore are designated TrbK. Positional analogy to family TIGR04359 (the entry exclusion lipoprotein TrbK of IncP plasmid RP4), which is a lipoprotein and not homologous, suggests this protein may also be involved in entry exclusion. Members of this family are small, with a non-lipoprotein signal peptide and a conserved disulfide bond.
