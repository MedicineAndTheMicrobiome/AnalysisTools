CC  Members of this family are included within the larger PF03102 (NeuB) family.  NeuB itself (TIGR03569) is involved in the biosynthesis of neuraminic acid by the condensation of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) with N-Acetyl-D-Mannosamine.  In an analagous reaction, this enzyme, PseI [1], condenses PEP with  6-deoxy-beta-L-AltNAc4NAc to generate pseudaminic acid.
