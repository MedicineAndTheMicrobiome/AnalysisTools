CC  This model describes MYXO-CTERM, a C-terminal putative protein sorting domain, analogous to LPXTG (TIGR01167) and PEP-CTERM (TIGR02595). It is restricted to the Myxococcales, a division of the Deltaproteobacteria, with over 60 members occurring in Plesiocystis pacifica SIR-1. An example protein is TraA, involved in outer membrane exchange (lipids and proteins) through which one strain of Myxococcus can repair a mobility defect in another. The trusted cutoff for this model is set artificially high to avoid false positives, and consequently only about half of all members are recognized.
