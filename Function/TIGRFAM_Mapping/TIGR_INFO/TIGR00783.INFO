CC  These proteins are members of the Citrate:Cation Symporter (CCS) Family (TC 2.A.24).  These proteins have 12 GES predicted transmembrane regions.  Most members of the CCS family catalyze citrate uptake with either Na+ or H+ as the cotransported cation.  However, one member is specific for L-malate and probably functions by a proton symport mechanism.
