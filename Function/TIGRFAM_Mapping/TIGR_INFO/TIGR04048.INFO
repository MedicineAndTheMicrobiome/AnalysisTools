CC  This family represents a subfamily of a C-N bond-cleaving hydrolases (see PF00795). Members occur as part of a cluster of genes in a probable biosynthetic cluster that contains a radical SAM protein, an N-acetyltransferase, a flavoprotein, several proteins of unknown function, and usually a glycosyltransferase. Members are closely related to a characterized aliphatic nitrilase from Rhodopseudomonas rhodochrous J1, for which an active site Cys was found at position 165.
