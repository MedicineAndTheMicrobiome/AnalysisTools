CC  This protein is a relatively rare aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase, found in the cytosolic compartment of eukaryotes, in E. coli and a number of other Gram-negative Bacteria, and in Deinococcus radiodurans. In contrast, the pathway to Gln-tRNA in mitochondria, Archaea, Gram-positive Bacteria, and a number of other lineages is by misacylation with Glu followed by transamidation to correct the aminoacylation to Gln. This enzyme is a class I tRNA synthetase (hit by the pfam HMM tRNA-synt_1c) and is quite closely related to glutamyl-tRNA synthetases.
