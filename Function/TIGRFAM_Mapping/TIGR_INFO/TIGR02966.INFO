CC  Members of this protein family are the regulatory histidine kinase PhoR associated with the phosphate ABC transporter in most Proteobacteria. Related proteins from Gram-positive organisms are not included in this model. The phoR gene usually is adjacent to the response regulator phoB gene (TIGR02154).
DR  PFAM; PF00512; His Kinase A (phosphoacceptor) domain
DR  PFAM; PF02518; ATPase, histidine kinase-, DNA gyrase B-, and HSP90-like domain protein
