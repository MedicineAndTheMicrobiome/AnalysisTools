CC  This model describes both iron- and cobalt-containing nitrile hydratase alpha chains. It excludes the thiocyanate hydrolase gamma subunit of Thiobacillus thioparus, a sequence that appears to have evolved from within the family of nitrile hydratase alpha subunits but which differs by several indels and a more rapid accumulation of point mutations.
