CC  This HMM represents signal peptidase I from most archaea, a subunit of the eukaryotic endoplasmic reticulum signal peptidase I complex, and an apparent signal peptidase I from a small number of bacteria. It is related to but does not overlap in hits with TIGR02227, the bacterial and mitochondrial signal peptidase I.
