CC  This model describes the Na+/K+ ATPase beta subunit in eukaryotes. Na+/K+ ATPase(also called Sodium-Potassium pump) is intimately associated with the plasma membrane. It couples the energy released by the hydrolysis of ATP to extrude 3 Na+ ions, with the concomitant uptake of 2K+ ions, against their ionic gradients.
