CC  Dissimilatory sulfite reductase catalyzes the six-electron reduction of sulfite to sulfide, as the terminal reaction in dissimilatory sulfate reduction. It remains unclear however, whether trithionate and thiosulfate serve as intermediate compounds to sulfide, or as end products of sulfite reduction [1].
CC  Sulfite reductase is a multisubunit enzyme composed of dimers of either alpha/beta or alpha/beta/gamma subunits, each containing a siroheme and iron sulfur cluster prosthetic center [2]. Found in sulfate-reducing bacteria, these genes are commonly located in an unidirectional gene cluster [3].
CC  This model describes the beta subunit of sulfite reductase.
