CC  Members of this protein family, to date, are found in a completed prokaryotic genome if and only if the species is one of the archaeal methanogens. The exact function is unknown, but likely is linked to methanogenesis or a process closely connected to it. Related proteins include the BadF/BadG/BcrA/BcrD ATPase family (PF01869), which includes an activator for (R)-2-hydroxyglutaryl-CoA dehydratase.
