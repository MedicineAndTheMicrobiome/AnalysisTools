CC  A GTP hydrolase for assembly of nickel metallocenter of hydrogenase. A similar protein, ureG, is an accessory protein for urease, which also uses nickel.
CC  hits scoring 75 and above are safe as orthologs.  [SS 1/05/04 I changed the role_ID and process GO from protein folding to to protein modification, since a protein folding role has not been established, but HypB is implicated in insertion of nickel into the large subunit of NiFe hydrogenases.]
