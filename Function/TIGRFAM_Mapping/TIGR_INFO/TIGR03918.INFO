CC  This model describes the family of the [Fe] hydrogenase maturation protein HypF as characterized in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and found, in an operon with radical SAM proteins HydE and HydG, in numerous bacteria. It has GTPase activity, can bind an 4Fe-4S cluster, and is essential for hydrogenase activity.
