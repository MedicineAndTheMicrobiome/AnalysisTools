CC  Viperin (Virus Inhibitory Protein, ER-associated, Iterferon-inducible) is a radical SAM enzyme found in human and other vertebrates. It is both induced by interferon and demonstrably active in blocking replication by several types of virus, apparently by modifying lipid chemistries in lipid droplets and membrane rafts.
