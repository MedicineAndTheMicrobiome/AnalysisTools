CC  Members of this protein family are probable lipoproteins. Nearly every member ends with a C-terminal region consisting of a glycine-rich probable cleavage site, a hydrophobic probable transmembrane helix, and a cluster of basic residues, as described in putative protein sorting region model TIGR03501. Furthermore, members tend to be encoded next to a rhomboid family protease, called rhombosortase (TIGR03902) predicted to perform a C-terminal cleavage.
