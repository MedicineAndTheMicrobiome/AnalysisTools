CC  This model describes the coenzyme PQQ (pyrrolo-quinoline-quinone) biosynthesis protein PqqC.In contrast to the broader model PF05312, this model does not include related proteins likely to be functionally distinct from PqqC, such as homologs found in the Chlamydias.
DR  PFAM; PF05312; related but broader model.
