CC  This HMM describes a subset of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase specifically close by both phylogenetic and per cent identity (UPGMA) trees. Members of this set include two or three copies of the lipoyl-binding domain.  E. coli AceF is a member of this model, while mitochondrial and some other bacterial forms belong to a separate model.
