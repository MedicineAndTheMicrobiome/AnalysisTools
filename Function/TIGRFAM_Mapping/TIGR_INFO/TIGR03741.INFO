CC  A novel genetic system characterized by six or seven major proteins, included a ParB homolog and a ThiF homolog, is designated PRTRC, or ParB-Related,ThiF-Related Cassette. It is often found on plasmids. This protein family averages about 150 amino acids in length, but the last third contains low-complexity sequence that complicates sequence comparisons. This model does not include the low-complexity region.
