CC  A common motif in bacterial biosynthesis of polysaccharide for export is modification that follows polymerization. This HMM describes a subfamily of polysaccharide N-deacetylases that acts on poly-beta-1,6-N-acetyl-D-glyscosamine as produced by Staphylococcus epidermidis and S. aureus. The end product in these species is designated polysaccharide intercellular adhesin (PIA), and this gene designated icaB (intercellular adhesion protein B).
