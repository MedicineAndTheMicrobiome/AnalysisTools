CC  This protein is observed in operons extremely similar to that characterized in E. coli K-12 [1] responsible for the import and catabolism of pyrimidines, primarily uracil.  This protein is a member of the uracil-xanthine permease family defined by TIGR00801.  As well as the The Nucleobase:Cation Symporter-2 (NCS2) Family (TC 2.A.40).
