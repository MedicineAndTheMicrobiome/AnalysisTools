CC  This model represents the N-terminal domain of a paralogous family of Plasmodium yoelii genes preferentially located in the subtelomeric regions of the chromosomes [1].  There are no obvious homologs to these genes in any other organism.
CC  The C-terminal portions of the genes which contain this domain are divergent and some contain other yoelii-specific paralogous domains such as PYST-C2 (TIGR01604).
