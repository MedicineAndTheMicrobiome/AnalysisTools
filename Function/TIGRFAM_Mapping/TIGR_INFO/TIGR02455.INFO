CC  Trehalose synthase catalyzes a one-step conversion of maltose to trehalose. This is an alternative to the OtsAB and TreYZ pathways. This family includes a characterized example from Pseudomonas stutzeri plus very closely related sequences from other Pseudomonads. Cutoff scores are set to find a more distantly related sequence from Desulfovibrio vulgaris, likely to be functionally equivalent, between trusted and noise limits.
