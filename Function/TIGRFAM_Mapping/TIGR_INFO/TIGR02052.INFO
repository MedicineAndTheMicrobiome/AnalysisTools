CC  This HMM represents the periplasmic mercury (II) binding protein of the bacterial mercury detoxification system which passes mercuric ion to the MerT transporter for subsequent reduction to Hg(0) by the mercuric reductase MerA.  MerP contains a distinctive GMTCXXC motif associated with metal binding [1].  MerP is related to a larger family of metal binding proteins (PF00403).
