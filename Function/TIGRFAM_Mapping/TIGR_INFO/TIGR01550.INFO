CC  The characterized member of this family is the death-on-curing (DOC) protein of phage P1. It is part of a two protein operon with prevents-host-death (phd) that forms an addiction module. DOC lacks homology to analogous addiction module post-segregational killing proteins involved in plasmid maintenance. These modules work as a combination of a long lived poison (e.g. this protein) and a more abundant but shorter lived antidote.
CC  Members of this family have a well-conserved central motif HxFx[ND][AG]NKR.
CC  A similar region, with K replaced by G, is found in the huntingtin interacting protein (HYPE) family.
