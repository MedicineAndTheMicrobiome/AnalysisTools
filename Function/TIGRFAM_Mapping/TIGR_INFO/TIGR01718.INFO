CC  This model represents a family of bacterial and archaeal uridine phosphorylases unrelated to the mammalian enzymes of the same name.  The E. coli [1], Salmonella [2] and Klebsiella [3] genes have been characterized.
CC  Sequences from Clostridium, Streptomyces, Treponema, Halobacterium and Pyrobaculum were included above trusted on the basis of sequence homology and a PAM-based neighbor-joining tree.  A clade including second sequences from Halobacterium and Vibrio was somewhat more distantly related and may represent a slightly different substrate specificity - these were placed below the noise cutoff.  More distantly related is a clade of archaeal sequences which as related to the DeoD family of inosine phosphorylases (TIGR00107) as they are to these uridine phosphorylases.  This clade includes a characterized protein from Sulfolobus solfataricus which has been mis-named as a methylthioadenosine phosphorylase, but which acts on inosine and guanosine - it is unclear whether uridine has been evaluated as a substrate [4].
