CC  Rfam model RF00080 describes a structured RNA element called the yybP-ykoY leader, or SraF, which may precede one or several genes in a genome. Members of this highly hydrophobic protein family commonly are preceded by a yybP-ykoY leader, which may serve as a riboswitch. From the larger group of TerC homologs (PF03741), this subfamily contains protein YjbE from Bacillus subtilis. A transport function is proposed.
