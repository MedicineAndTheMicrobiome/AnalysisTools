CC  In the aerobic cobalamin biosythesis pathway, four enzymes are involved in the conversion of precorrin-3A to precorrin-6A. The first of the four steps is carried out by EC 1.14.13.83, precorrin-3B synthase (CobG), yielding precorrin-3B as the product.  This is followed by three methylation reactions, which introduce a methyl group at C-17 (CobJ; EC 2.1.1.131), C-11 (CobM; EC 2.1.1.133) and C-1 (CobF; EC 2.1.1.152) of the macrocycle, giving rise to precorrin-4, precorrin-5 and precorrin-6A, respectively [1].
CC  This model identifies CobF in High GC gram positive, alphaproteobacteria and pseudomonas-related species.
