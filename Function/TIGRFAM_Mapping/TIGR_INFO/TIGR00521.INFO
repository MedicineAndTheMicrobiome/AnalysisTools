CC  This HMM represents a bifunctional enzyme that catalyzes the second and third steps (cysteine ligation, EC 6.3.2.5, and decarboxylation, EC 4.1.1.36) in the biosynthesis of coenzyme A (CoA) from pantothenate in bacteria.  In early descriptions of this flavoprotein, a ts mutation in one region of the protein appeared to cause a defect in DNA metaobolism rather than an increased need for the pantothenate precursor beta-alanine. This protein was then called dfp, for DNA/pantothenate metabolism flavoprotein. The authors responsible for detecting phosphopantothenate--cysteine ligase activity suggest renaming this bifunctional protein coaBC for its role in CoA biosynthesis. This enzyme contains the FMN cofactor, but no FAD or pyruvoyl group. The amino-terminal region contains the phosphopantothenoylcysteine decarboxylase activity.
