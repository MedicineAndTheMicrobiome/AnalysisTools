CC  See Medline:98153179 for function. This protein is suggested by act as a chaperone for a hydrogenase large subunit, holding the precursor form before metallocenter nickel incorporation.     
CC  [SS 12/31/03] More recently proposed additional function is to shuttle the iron atom that has been liganded at the HypC/HypD complex to the precursor of the large hydrogenase (HycE) subunit. PMID:12441107.  Added metallochaperone and protein mod GO terms.
