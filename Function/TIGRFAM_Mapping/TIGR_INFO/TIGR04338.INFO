CC  This protein family is restricted to the Actinomycetales, including Mycobacterium, Rhodococcus, Nocardia, Gordonii, and others. The invariant motif HEXXH, at the core of the best conserved region in the protein, suggests metallohydrolase activity, as does local sequence similarity in this region to other metallohydrolases.
