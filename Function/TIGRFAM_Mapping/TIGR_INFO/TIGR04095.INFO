CC  The DNA phosphorothioate modification system dnd (DNA instability during electrophoresis) recently has been shown to provide a modification essential to a restriction system. This protein family was detected by Partial Phylogenetic Profiling as linked to dnd, and its members usually are clustered with the dndABCDE genes.
