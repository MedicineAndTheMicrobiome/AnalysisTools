CC  Characterized members of the RND superfamily all probably catalyze substrate efflux via an H+ antiport mechanism. These proteins are found ubiquitously in bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. They fall into seven phylogenetic families, this family (2.A.6.7) consists of uncharacterised putative transporters, largely in the Archaea.
