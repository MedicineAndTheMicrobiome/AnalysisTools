CC  This peptide is the protein component of a ribonucleoprotein that cleaves the leader sequence from each tRNA precursor to leave the mature 5'-terminus. The catalytic site is in the RNA component, M1 RNA.
CC  The yeast mitochondrial RNase P protein component gene RPM2 has no obvious sequence similarity to rnpA, but resembles eukaryotic nuclear RNase P instead.
