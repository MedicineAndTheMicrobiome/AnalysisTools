CC  This family of CoA transferases includes enzymes catalyzing at least two related but distinct activities.  The E. coli YgfH protein has been characterized as a propionyl-CoA:succinate CoA transferase [1] where it appears to be involved in a pathway for the decarboxylation of succinate to propionate.  The Clostridium kluyveri CAT1 protein has been characterized as a acetyl-CoA:succinate CoA transferase [2] and is believed to be involved in anaerobic succinate degradation.
CC  The propionate:succinate transferase activity has been reported in the propionic acid fermentation of propionibacterium species [3] where it is distinct from the coupled activities of distinct nucleotide-triphosphate dependent succinate and propionate/acetate CoA transferases (as inferred from activity in the absence of NTPs).  The family represented by this model includes a member from Propionibacterium acnes KPA171202 which is likely to be responsible for this activity.
CC  A closely related clade not included in this family are the Ach1p proteins of fungi which are acetyl-CoA hydrolases [4].  This name has been applied to many of the proteins modeled by this HMM, possibly erroneously.
