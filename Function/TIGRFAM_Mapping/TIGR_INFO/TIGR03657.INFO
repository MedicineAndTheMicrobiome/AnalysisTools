CC  Isd proteins are iron-regulated surface proteins found in Bacillus, Staphylococcus and Listeria species and are responsible for heme scavenging from hemoproteins [1].  The IsdB protein is only observed in Staphylococcus and consists of an N-terminal hydrophobic signal sequence, a pair of tandem NEAT (NEAr Transporter, PF05031) domains which confers the ability to bind heme [2] and a C-terminal sortase processing signal which targets the protein to the cell wall.  IsdB is believed to make a direct contact with methemoglobin facilitating transfer of heme to IsdB [3].  The heme is then transferred to other cell wall-bound NEAT domain proteins such as IsdA and IsdC.
