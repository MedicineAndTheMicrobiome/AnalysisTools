CC  This family consists of a broadly distributed uncharacterized domain found often as a standalone protein. The member from Shewanella oneidensis, PDB|1T82_A (Forouhar, et al., unpublished) is described from crystallography work as a putative thioesterase.  About half of the members of this family are fused to an Acetyltransf_1 domain (PFAM model PF00583). The function of this protein is unknown.
