CC  Members of this protein family represent a subset of those belonging to Pfam family PF00188 (SCP-like extracellular protein). Based on currently cuttoffs for this model, all member proteins are found in Bacteria capable of endospore formation. Members include a named but uncharacterized protein, YkwD of Bacillus subtilis. Only the C-terminal region is well-conserved and is included in the seed alignment for this model. Three members of this family have an N-terminal domain homologous to the spore coat assembly protein SafA.
