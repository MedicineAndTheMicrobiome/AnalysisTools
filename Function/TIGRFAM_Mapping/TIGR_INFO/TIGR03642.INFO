CC  This model describes a protein N-terminal protein sequence domain strictly associated with CRISPR and CRISPR-associated protein systems. This model and TIGR02584 identify two separate clades from a larger homology domain family, both CRISPR-associated, while other homologs are found that may not be. Members are found in bacteria that include Pelotomaculum thermopropionicum SI, Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis MB4, and Roseiflexus sp. RS-1, and in archaea that include Thermoplasma volcanium, Picrophilus torridus, and Methanospirillum hungatei. The molecular function is unknown.
