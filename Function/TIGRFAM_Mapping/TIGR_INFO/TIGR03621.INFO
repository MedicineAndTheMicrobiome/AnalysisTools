CC  Coenzyme F420 is produced by methanogenic archaea, a number of the Actinomycetes (including Mycobacterium tuberculosis), and rare members of other lineages. The resulting information-rich phylogenetic profile identifies candidate F420-dependent oxidoreductases within the family of luciferase-like enzymes (PF00296), where the species range for the subfamily encompasses many F420-positive genomes without straying beyond. This family is uncharacterized, and named for member MSMEG_2516 from Mycobacterium smegmatis.
