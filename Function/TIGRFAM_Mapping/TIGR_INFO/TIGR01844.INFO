CC  Members of this HMM are outer membrane proteins from the TolC subfamily within the RND (Resistance-Nodulation-cell Division) efflux systems. These proteins, unlike the NodT subfamily, appear not to be lipoproteins. All are believed to participate in type I protein secretion, an ABC transporter system for protein secretion without cleavage of a signal sequence, although they may, like TolC, participate also in the efflux of smaller molecules as well. This family includes the well-documented examples TolC (E. coli), PrtF  (Erwinia),  and AprF (Pseudomonas aeruginosa).
