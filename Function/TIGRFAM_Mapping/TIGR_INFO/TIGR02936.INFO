CC  Members of this family are homodimeric ferredoxins from nitrogen fixation regions of many nitrogen-fixing bacteria. As characterized in Rhodobacter capsulatus, these proteins are homodimeric, with two 4Fe-4S clusters bound per monomer. Although nif-specific, this protein family is not usiveral, as other nitrogenase systems may substitute flavodoxins, or different types of ferredoxin.
