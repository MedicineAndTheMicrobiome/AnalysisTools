CC  Two members of this family are found in Colwellia psychrerythraea 34H and one each in various other species of Colwellia and Shewanella. One member from C. psychrerythraea is of special interest because it is preceded by the same cis-regulatory site as a number of genes that have the PEP-CTERM domain described by TIGR02595.
