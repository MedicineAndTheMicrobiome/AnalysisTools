CC  This model represents a prokaryotic N-terminal region of about 80 amino acids. The predicted membrane topology by TMHMM puts the N-terminus outside and spans the membrane twice, with a cytosolic region of about 25 amino acids between the two transmembrane regions. Member proteins tend to be between 600 and 1000 amino acids in length.
