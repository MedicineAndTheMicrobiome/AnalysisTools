CC  This family consists of examples of the putative ADP-heptose:LPS heptosyltransferase III, an enzyme of LPS inner core region biosynthesis. LPS, composed of lipid A, a core region, and O antigen, is found in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. This enzyme may be less widely distributed than heptosyltransferases I and II.
