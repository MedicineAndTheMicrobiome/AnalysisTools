CC  This HMM represents a domain found toward the C-terminus
CC  of a number of uncharacterized plant proteins. The domain is strongly conserved (greater than 30 % sequence identity between most pairs of members) but flanked by highly divergent regions including stretches of low-complexity sequence.
