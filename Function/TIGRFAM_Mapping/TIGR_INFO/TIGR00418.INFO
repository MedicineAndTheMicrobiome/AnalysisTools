CC  This HMM represents the threonyl-tRNA synthetase found in most organisms. This protein is a class II tRNA synthetase, and is recognized by the pfam HMM tRNA-synt_2b. Note that B. subtilis has closely related isozymes thrS and thrZ. The N-terminal regions are quite dissimilar between archaeal and eubacterial forms, while some eukaryotic forms are missing sequence there altogether. .
