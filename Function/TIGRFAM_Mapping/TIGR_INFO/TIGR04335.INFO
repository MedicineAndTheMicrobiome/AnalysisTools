CC  Members of this protein family belong to the same domain family as AMMECR1, a mammalian protein named for AMME - Alport syndrome, Mental Retardation, Midface hypoplasia, and Elliptocytosis. Members of the present family occur as part of a three gene system with a homolog of the mammalian protein Memo (Mediator of ErbB2-driven cell MOtility), and an uncharacterized radical SAM enzyme.
