CC  CRISPR loci appear to be mobile elements with a wide host range. This HMM represents a protein that tends to be found near CRISPR repeats. The species range for this species, so far, is exclusively archaeal. It is found so far in only four different species, and includes two tandem genes in Pyrococcus furiosus DSM 3638. This subfamily is found in a CRISPR/Cas locus we designate APERN, so the family is designated Csa4, for CRISPR/Cas Subtype Protein 4.
