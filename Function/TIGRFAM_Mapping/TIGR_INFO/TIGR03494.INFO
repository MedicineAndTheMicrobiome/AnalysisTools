CC  Members of this protein family are salicylate synthases, bifunctional enzymes that make salicylate, in two steps, from chorismate. Members are homologous to anthranilate synthase component I from Trp biosynthesis. Members typically are found in gene regions associated with siderophore or other secondary metabolite biosynthesis.
