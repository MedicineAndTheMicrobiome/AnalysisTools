CC  Members of this family form a distinct clade within a larger family of proteins that also includes coenzyme F390 synthetase, an enzyme known in Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum and a few other methanogenic archaea. That enzyme adenylates coenzyme F420 to F390, a reversible process, during oxygen stress. Other informative homologies include domains of the non-ribosomal peptide synthetases involved in activation by adenylation. The family defined by this model is likely to be of an adenylate-forming enzyme related to but distinct from coenzyme F390 synthetase.
