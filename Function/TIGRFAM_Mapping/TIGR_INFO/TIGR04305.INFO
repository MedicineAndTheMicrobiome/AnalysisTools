CC  This protein family, related to but outside the family of PqqC proteins involved in PQQ biosynthesis, includes the well-studied Chlamydia protein CADD (Chlamydia protein Associating with Death Domains), which can induce apoptosis in a host cell. Other members of this family occur in Rickettsia and Wolbachia, unrelated in terms of phylogeny (both are alphaproteobacteria) but similar in living intracellularly. Local gene context in these species, although not in Trichodesmium or Nitrosomonas eutropha, suggests a role in folate metabolism, and some species with this protein lack FolE but have other folate synthesis proteins.
