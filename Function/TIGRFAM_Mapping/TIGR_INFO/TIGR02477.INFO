CC  Diphosphate--fructose-6-phosphate 1-phosphotransferase catalyzes the addition of phosphate from diphosphate (PPi) to fructose 6-phosphate to give fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (EC 2.7.1.90). The enzyme is also known as pyrophosphate-dependent phosphofructokinase. The usage of PPi-dependent enzymes in glycolysis presumably frees up ATP for other processes [1].  TIGR02482 represents the ATP-dependent 6-phosphofructokinase enzyme contained within Pfam PF00365: Phosphofructokinase. This model hits primarily bacterial, plant alpha, and plant beta sequences.
