CC  This HMM describes a set of proteins that share low levels of sequence similarity but similar lengths and similar patterns of charged, hydrophobic, and Gly/Pro residues. All members (except one attributed to mouse embryo cDNA) belong to phage of Gram-positive bacteria. Several are identified as phage major tail proteins. Some members of this family have additional C-terminal regions of about 100 residues not included in this model.
