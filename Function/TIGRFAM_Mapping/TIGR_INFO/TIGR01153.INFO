CC  This model describes the Photosystem II, 44kDa subunit (also called P6 protein, CP43) in bacterial and its equivalents in chloroplast of algae and higher plants. Photosystem II is in many ways functionally equivalent to bacterial reaction center. At the core of Photosystem II are several light harvesting cofactors including plastoquinones, pheophytins, phyloquinones etc. These cofactors are intimately associated with the polypeptides, which principally including subunits 44 kDa protein,DI, DII, Cyt.b, Cyt.f, iron-sulphur protein and others. Functinally 44 kDa subunit is imlicated in chlorophyll binding. Together they participate in the electron transfer reactions that lead to the net production of the reducting equivalents in the form of NADPH, which are used for reduction of CO2 to carbohydrates(C6H1206). Phosystem II operates during oxygenic photosynthesis and principal electron donor is H2O. Although no high resolution X-ray structural data is presently available, recently a 3D structure of the supercomplex has been described by cryo-electron microscopy. Besides a huge body of literature exits that describes function using a variety of biochemical and biophysical techniques.
