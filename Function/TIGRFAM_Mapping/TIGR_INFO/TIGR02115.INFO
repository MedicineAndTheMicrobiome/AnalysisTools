CC  This HMM describes a very small integral membrane peptide KdpF, a subunit of the K(+)-translocating Kdp complex. It is found upstream of the KdpA subunit (TIGR00680). Because of its very small size and highly hydrophobic character, it is sometimes missed in genome annotation.
RM  10608856
RT  The KdpF subunit is part of the K(+)-translocating Kdp complex of Escherichia coli and is responsible for stabilization of the complex in vitro.
