CC  Members of this family are the B12-binding domain/radical SAM domain enzyme tryptophan methyltransferase, named TsrT in the cassette for thiostrepton biosynthesis. Thiostrepton and related thiopeptides are synthesized by extensive modification of a ribosomally translated product, but this enzyme is involved in a pathway that converts a free Trp residue to a quinaldic acid moiety before it is appended.
