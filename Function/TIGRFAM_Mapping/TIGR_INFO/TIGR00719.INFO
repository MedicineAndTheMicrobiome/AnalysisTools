CC  This enzyme is also called serine deaminase.
CC  This model describes the beta chain of an iron-sulfur-dependent L-serine dehydratase, as in Bacillus subtilis. A fairly deep split in a UPGMA tree separates members of this family of beta chains from the homologous region of single chain forms such as found in E. coli.
CC  This family of enzymes is not homologous to the pyridoxal phosphate-dependent threonine deaminases and eukaryotic serine deaminases.
