CC  Members of this protein family have been studied extensively by crystallography. Members from several different species have been shown to have sufficient thiamin phosphate synthase activity (EC 2.5.1.3) to complement thiE mutants. However, it is presumed that this is a secondary activity, and the primary function of this enzyme remains unknown.
