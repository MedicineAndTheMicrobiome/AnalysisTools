CC  Bacterial ProB proteins hit the full length of this model, but the ProB-like domain of  delta 1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase does not hit the C-terminal 100 residues of this model. The noise cutoff is set low enough to hit delta 1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase and other partial matches to this family.
