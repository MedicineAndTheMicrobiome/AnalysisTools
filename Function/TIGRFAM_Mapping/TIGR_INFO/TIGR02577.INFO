CC  This model represent a Crm2 family of the CRISPR-associated RAMP module, a set of six genes recurring found together in prokaryotic genomes. This gene cluster is found only in species with CRISPR repeats, usually near the repeats themselves. Because most of the six (but not this family) contain RAMP domains, and because its appearance in a genome appears to depend on other CRISPR-associated Cas genes, the set is designated the CRISPR RAMP module. This protein, typified by TM1794 from Thermotoga maritima, is designated Crm2, for CRISPR RAMP Module protein 2.
