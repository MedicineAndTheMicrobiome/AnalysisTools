CC  Members of this protein family are CDP-glucose 4,6-dehydratase from a variety of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Members typically are encoded next to a gene that encodes a glucose-1-phosphate cytidylyltransferase, which produces the substrate, CDP-D-glucose, used by this enzyme to produce CDP-4-keto-6-deoxyglucose.
