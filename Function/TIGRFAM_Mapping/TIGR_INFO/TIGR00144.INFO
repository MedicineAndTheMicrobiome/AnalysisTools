CC  This protein family contains several archaeal examples of beta-ribofuranosylaminobenzene 5-prime-phosphate synthase (beta-RFAP synthase), an enzyme involved in methanopterin biosynthesis. In some species, two members of this family are found. It is unclear whether both act as beta-RFAP synthase. This family is related to the GHMP kinases (Galactokinase, Homoserine kinase, Mevalonate kinase, Phosphomevalonate kinase). Members are found so far only in the Archaea and in Methylobacterium extorquens.
