CC  This protein is homologous to a family of proteins that includes thioredoxins, glutaredoxins, protein-disulfide isomerases, and others, some of which have several such domains. The sequence of this protein at the redox-active disufide site, CPYC, matches glutaredoxins rather than thioredoxins, although its overall sequence seems closer to thioredoxins. It is suggested to be a ribonucleotide-reducing system component distinct from thioredoxin or glutaredoxin.
