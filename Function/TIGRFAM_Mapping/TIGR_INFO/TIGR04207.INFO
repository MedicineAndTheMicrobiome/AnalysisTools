CC  This N-terminal homology domain appears to be a specialized class of signal peptide. It occurs mostly in the halophilic archaea, primarily on proteins with the C-terminal PGF-CTERM domain,  including the S-layer-forming major surface glycoprotein of several species. The PGF-CTERM domain is the putative archaeosortase A recognition sequence. However, this N-terminal domain occurs also in several archaeal proteins that lack PGF-CTERM, and occurs in bacteria on a protein from Clostridium leptum DSM 753.
