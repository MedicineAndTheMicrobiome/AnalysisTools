CC  This family, related to streptomycin biosynthesis protein StrG and to phytanoyl-CoA dioxygenase, belongs to the 2-oxoglutarate and Fe(II)-dependent oxygenase superfamily, which includes not just dioxygenases, but also some chlorinating enzymes involved in natural product biosynthesis. Most members of this family are adjacent to a member of TIGR04323, and occur in a larger carbohydrate biosynthesis cluster found sporadically in genera Bradyrhizobium, Leptospira, Magnetospirillum, Oscillatoria, Prochlorococcus, etc.
