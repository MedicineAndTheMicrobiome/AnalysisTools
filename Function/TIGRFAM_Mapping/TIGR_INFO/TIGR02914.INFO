CC  In Methylobacillus sp strain 12S, EpsI is encoded immediately downstream of the multiple-membrane-spanning putative transporter EpsH, and is predicted to be a periplasmic protein involved in, but not required for, expression of the exopolysaccharide methanolan. In a number of other species, protein homologous to EpsI is encoded either next to EpsH or, more often, combined in a fused gene. We have proposed renaming EpsH, or the EpsHI fusion protein, to exosortase, based on its phylogenetic association with the PEP-CTERM proposed protein targeting signal.
