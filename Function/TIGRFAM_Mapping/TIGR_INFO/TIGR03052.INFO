CC  Members of this protein family are PsaI, subunit VIII of the photosystem I reaction center. This protein is found in both the Cyanobacteria and the chloroplasts of plants, but is absent from non-oxygenic photosynthetic bacteria such as Rhodobacter sphaeroides. Species that contain photosystem I also contain photosystem II, which splits water and releases molecular oxygen.
