CC  Triphosphoribosyl-dephospho-CoA is transferred to, and becomes the prosthetic group of, the respective acyl carrier protein subunits of both citrate lyase and malonate decarboxylase. Members of this protein family are triphosphoribosyl-dephospho-CoA synthases specifically from citrate lyase systems. This protein sometimes occurs as a fusion protein with CitX, the phosphoribosyl-dephospho-CoA transferase.
