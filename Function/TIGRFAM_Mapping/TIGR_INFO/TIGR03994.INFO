CC  Members of this radical SAM protein family are HemZ, a protein involved in coproporphyrinogen III decarboxylation. Alternative names for this enzyme (EC 1.3.99.22) include coproporphyrinogen dehydrogenase and oxygen-independent coproporphyrinogen III oxidase. The family is related to, but distinct from HemN, and in Bacillus subtilis was shown to be connected to peroxide stress and catalase formation.
