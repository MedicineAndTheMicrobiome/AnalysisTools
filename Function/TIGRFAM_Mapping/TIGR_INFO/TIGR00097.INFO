CC  This HMM represents a bifunctional enzyme, phosphomethylpyrimidine kinase (EC 2.7.4.7)/Hydroxymethylpyrimidine kinase (EC 2.7.1.49), the ThiD/J protein of thiamine biosynthesis. The protein is commonly observed within operons containing other thiamine biosynthesis genes. Numerous examples are fusion proteins with other thiamine-biosynthetic domains. Saccaromyces has three recent paralogs, two of which are isofunctional and score above the trusted cutoff. The third shows a longer branch length in a phylogenetic tree and scores below the trusted cutoff, as do putative second copies in a number of species.
