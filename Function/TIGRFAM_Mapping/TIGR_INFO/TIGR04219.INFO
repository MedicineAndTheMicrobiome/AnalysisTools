CC  Members of this protein family are outer membrane proteins (OMP), as can be seen by their homology to YfaZ protein (see PMID:16522795) and by the OMP targeting region at the C-terminus, including a C-terminal Phe residue. Members of this protein family are found in the great majority of genomes with the GlyGly-CTERM protein sorting signal and the rhombosortase putative sorting enzyme, although the relationship may be fortuitous.
