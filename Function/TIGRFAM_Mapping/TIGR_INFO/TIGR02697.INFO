CC  This domain conceptually resembles TIGR01045, the Rickettsial palindromic element (RPE) domain. In both cases, a protein-coding palindromic element spreads through a genome, inserting usually in protein-coding regions. The additional protein coding sequence is thought to allow function of the host protein because of location in surface-exposed regions of  the protein structure. Note that this model appears to work better in fragment mode.
