CC  Sulfite reductase (NADPH) catalyzes a six electron reduction of sulfite to sulfide in prokaryotic organisms. It is a complex oligomeric enzyme composed of two different peptides with a subunit composition of alpha(8)-beta(4) [1]. The alpha component, encoded by cysJ, is a flavoprotein containing both FMN and FAD, while the beta component, encoded by cysI, is a siroheme, iron-sulfur protein [1].
CC  In Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli, both the alpha and beta subunits of sulfite reductase are located in a unidirectional gene cluster along with phosphoadenosine phosphosulfate reductase, which catalyzes a two step reduction of PAPS to give free sulfite [2].
CC  In cyanobacteria and plant species, sulfite reductase ferredoxin (EC 1.8.7.1) catalyzes the reduction of sulfite to sulfide [3].
