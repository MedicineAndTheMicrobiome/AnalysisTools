CC  Hercynine is the betaine (trimethylated amino group) form of histidine. This small protein occurs in a conserved four-gene cyanobacterial cassette along with a EgtD, the methyltransferase that converts histidine to hercynine, and an EgtB homolog as in ergothioneine biosynthesis, likely to attach some thiol through its sulfur to the imidazole ring.
