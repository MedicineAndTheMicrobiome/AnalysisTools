CC  This model decribes the photosynthetic reaction center M subunit in non-oxygenic photosynthetic bacteria. Reaction center is an  integral membrane pigment-protein that carries out light-driven electron transfer reactions. At the core of reacion center is a collection light-harvesting cofactors and closely associated polypeptides. The core protein complex is made of L, M and H subunits. The common cofactors include bacterichlorophyll, bacteriopheophytins, ubiquinone and no-heme ferrous iron. The net result of electron tranfer reactions is the establishment of proton electrochemical gradient and production of reducing equivalents in form of NADH. Ultimately the process results in the reduction of C02 to carbohydrates(C6H12O6) In non-oxygenic organisms, the electron donor is some organic acid and not water. Much of our current functional understanding of photosynthesis comes from the structural determination, spectroscopic studies and mutational analysis on the reaction center of Rhodobacter sphaeroides.
