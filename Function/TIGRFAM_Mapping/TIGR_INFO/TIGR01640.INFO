CC  This HMM describes a large family of plant domains, with several hundred members in Arabidopsis thaliana. Most examples are found C-terminal to an F-box (PF00646), a 60 amino acid motif involved in ubiquitination of target proteins to mark them for degradation. Two-hybid experiments support the idea that most members are interchangeable F-box subunits of SCF E3 complexes. Some members have two copies of this domain.
RM  12169662
RT  The F-box subunit of the SCF E3 complex is encoded by a diverse superfamily of genes in Arabidopsis.
