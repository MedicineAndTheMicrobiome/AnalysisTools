CC  In many but not all taxa, there is a conserved real translational frameshift at a TGA codon. RF-2 helps terminate translation at TGA codons and can therefore regulate its own production by readthrough when RF-2 is insufficient. There is a PFAM HMM called "RF-1" for the superfamily of RF-1, RF-2, mitochondrial, RF-H, etc.
