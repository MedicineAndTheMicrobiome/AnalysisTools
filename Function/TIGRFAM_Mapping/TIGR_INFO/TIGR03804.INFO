EN  parallel beta-helix repeat (two copies)
TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  This model represents a tandem pair of an approximately 22-amino acid (each) repeat homologous to the beta-strand repeats that stack in a right-handed parallel beta-helix in the periplasmic C-5 mannuronan epimerase, AlgA, of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A homology domain consisting of a longer tandem array of these repeats is described in the SMART database as CASH (SM00722), and is found in many carbohydrate-binding proteins and sugar hydrolases. A single repeat is represented by SM00710. This TIGRFAMs model represents a flavor of the parallel beta-helix-forming repeat based on prokaryotic sequences only in its seed alignment, although it also finds many eukaryotic sequences.
