EN  LPXTG-site transpeptidase (sortase) family protein
EC  3.4.22.-
TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  This family includes Staphylococcus aureus sortase, a transpeptidase that attaches surface proteins by the Thr
CC  of an LPXTG motif to the cell wall. It also includes a protein required for correct assembly of an LPXTG-containing fimbrial protein, a set of homologous proteins from Streptococcus pneumoniae, in which LPXTG proteins are common. However, related proteins are found in Bacillus subtilis and Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum, in which LPXTG-mediated cell wall attachment is not known.
