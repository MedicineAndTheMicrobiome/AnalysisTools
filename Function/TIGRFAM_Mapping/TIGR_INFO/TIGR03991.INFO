CC  The MJ_1101 protein from Methanococcus jannaschii has been characterized as the GlmU enzyme catalyzing the final two steps of UDP-GlcNAc biosynthesis [1].  Homologs of this enzyme are identified in a number of bacterial organisms and modeled here.  A number of these are observed in proximity to the GlmS and GlmM genes, and phylogenetic profiling by PPP [2] identifies the LEPBI_I0518 gene in Leptospira biflexa as a likely Glm-system candidate.  Multiple sequence alignments of these bacterial homologs with their archaeal counterparts reveals significant structural differences, necessitating the construction of separate models.
