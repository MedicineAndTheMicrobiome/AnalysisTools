CC  Members of this protein family have a novel N-terminal domain, a single predicted membrane-spanning helix, and a predicted cystosolic histidine kinase domain. We designate this protein PrsK, and its companion DNA-binding response regulator protein (TIGR02915) PrsR. These predicted signal-transducing proteins appear to enable enhancer-dependent transcriptional activation. The prsK gene is often associated with exopolysaccharide biosynthesis genes.
