TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  This HMM represents a set of proteins with extensive C-terminal homology to the ATP-dependent protease La, product of the lon gene of E. coli. The model is based on a seed alignment containing only archaeal members, but several bacterial proteins match the model well. Because several species, including Thermotoga maritima and Treponema pallidum, contain both a close homolog of the lon protease and nearly full-length homolog of the  members of this family, we suggest there may also be a functional division between the two families.
CC  Members of this family from Pyrococcus horikoshii and Pyrococcus abyssi each contain a predicted intein.
