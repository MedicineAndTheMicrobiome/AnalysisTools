CC  Nodulation factors are lipo-chitooligosaccharides made by bacterial nitrogen-fixing bacteria as a signal to plant hosts. Nod factors differ slightly from system to system are serve as host range determinants. Because the N-acyl group varies from one NodA to another, the family treated as a subfamily, but all members of this family belong to NodABC systems.
