CC  This HMM represents a family of proteins associated with CRISPR repeats in a wide set of prokaryotic genomes. This scope of this model has been broadened since it was first built to describe an archaeal subset only. The function of the protein is undefined. Distantly related proteins, excluded from this model, include ORFs from  Mycobacteriophage D29 and Sulfolobus islandicus filamentous virus and a region of the Schizosaccharomyces pombe DNA replication helicase Dna2p.
