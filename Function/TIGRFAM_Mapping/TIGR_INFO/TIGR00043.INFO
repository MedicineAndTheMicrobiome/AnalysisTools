CC  This metalloprotein family is represented by a single  member sequence only in nearly every bacterium. Crystallography demonstrated metal-binding activity, possibly to nickel. It is a predicted to be a metallohydrolase, and more recently it was shown that mutants have a ribosomal RNA processing defect.
