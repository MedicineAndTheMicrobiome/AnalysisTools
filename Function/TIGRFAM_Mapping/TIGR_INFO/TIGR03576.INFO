CC  Members of this archaeal protein family are pyridoxal phosphate enzymes of unknown function. Sequence similarity to SelA, a bacterial enzyme of selenocysteine biosynthesis, has led to some members being misannotated as functionally equivalent, but selenocysteine is made on tRNA in Archaea by a two-step process that does not involve a SelA homolog.
