CC  The leucyl-tRNA synthetases belong to two families so broadly different that they are represented by separate models. This model includes both eubacterial and mitochondrial leucyl-tRNA synthetases. It generates higher scores for some valyl-tRNA synthetases than for any archaeal or eukaryotic cytosolic leucyl-tRNA synthetase. Note that the enzyme from Aquifex aeolicus is split into alpha and beta chains; neither chain is long enough to score above the trusted cutoff, but the alpha chain scores well above the noise cutoff. The beta chain must be found by a model and search designed for partial length matches.
