CC  CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) is a widespread family of prokaryotic direct repeats with spacers of unique sequence between consecutive repeats. This protein family is a CRISPR-associated (Cas) family strictly associated with the Cyano subtype of CRISPR/Cas locus, found in several species of Cyanobacteria and several archaeal species. This family is designated Csc2 for CRISPR/Cas Subtype Cyano protein 2, as it is often the second gene upstream of the core cas genes, cas3-cas4-cas1-cas2.
