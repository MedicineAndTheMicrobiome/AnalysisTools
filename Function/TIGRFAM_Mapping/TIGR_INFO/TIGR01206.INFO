CC  This very small, poorly characterized protein has been shown essential in Thermus thermophilus for an unusual pathway of Lys biosynthesis from aspartate by way of alpha-aminoadipate (AAA) rather than diaminopimelate. It is found also in Deinococcus radiodurans and Pyrococcus horikoshii, which appear to share the AAA pathway.
