CC  The only examples in which the wobble position of a tRNA must discriminate between G and A of mRNA are AUA (Ile) vs. AUG (Met) and UGA (stop) vs. UGG (Trp). In all bacteria, the wobble position of the tRNA(Ile) recognizing AUA is lysidine, a lysine derivative of cytidine. This family describes a protein domain found, apparently, in all bacteria in a single copy. Eukaryotic sequences appear to be organellar. The domain archictecture of this protein family is variable; some, including characterized proteins of E. coli and B. subtilis known to be tRNA(Ile)-lysidine synthetase, include a conserved 50-residue domain that many other members lack. This protein belongs to the ATP-binding PP-loop family ( PF01171). It appears in the literature and protein databases as TilS, YacA, and putative cell cycle protein MesJ (a misnomer).
