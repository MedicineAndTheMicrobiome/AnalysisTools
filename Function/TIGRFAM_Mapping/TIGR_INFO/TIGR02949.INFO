CC  This group of anti-sigma factors are associated in an apparent operon with a family of sigma-70 family sigma factors (TIGR02947).  They and appear by homology, tree building, bidirectional best hits and one-to-a-genome distribution, to represent a conserved family.  This family is restricted to the Actinobacteria.
