CC  This HMM represents a portion of the proteins within the larger set covered by Pfam model PF03960. That larger family includes a glutaredoxin-dependent arsenate reductase (TIGR00014). Characterized members of this family include Spx and MgsR from Bacillus subtili. Spx is a global regulator for response to thiol-specific oxidative stress. It interacts with RNA polymerase. MgsR (modulator of the general stress response, also called YqgZ) provides a second level of regulation for more than a third of the proteins in the B. subtilis general stress regulon controlled by Sigma-B.
