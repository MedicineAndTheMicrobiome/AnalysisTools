CC  This domain occurs as the C-terminal region in a number of proteins that have extensive collagen-like triple helix repeat regions. Member domains are predicted by TmHMM to have four or five transmembrane helices. Members are found mostly in the Firmicutes, but also in Acanthamoeba polyphaga mimivirus. Members include spore surface glycoprotein BclB from Bacillus anthracis, a protein of the exosporium. The exosporium is an additional outermost spore layer, lacking in B. subtilis and most other spore formers, consisting of a basal layer and, above it, a nap of fine filaments.
