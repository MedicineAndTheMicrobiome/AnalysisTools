CC  Members of this family are class II examples of the glycolytic enzyme fructose-bisphosphate aldolase (FBA).
CC  This HMM represents one of two deeply split, architecturally distinct clades of the family that includes class II fructose-bisphosphate aldolases, tagatose-bisphosphate aldolases, and related uncharacterized proteins. This family is well-conserved and includes characterized FBA from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Escherichia coli, and Corynebacterium glutamicum. Proteins outside the scope of this model may also be designated as class II fructose-bisphosphate aldolases, but are well separated in an alignment-based phylogenetic tree.
