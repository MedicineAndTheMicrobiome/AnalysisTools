CC  Members of this family are widely (though sparsely) distributed bacterial proteins about 230 residues in length. All members have a motif RxxRDxRFxxx[DN]KxxY. The function of this protein family is unknown. In several fungi, this model identifies a conserved region of a longer protein. Therefore, it may be incorrect to speculate that all members share a common function.
