CC  This HMM represents HrpA, one of two related but uncharacterized DEAH-box ATP-dependent helicases in many Proteobacteria and a few high-GC Gram-positive bacteria. HrpA is about 1300 amino acids long, while its paralog HrpB, also uncharacterized, is about 800 amino acids long. Related characterized eukarotic proteins are RNA helicases associated with pre-mRNA processing. The HrpA/B homolog from Borrelia is 500 amino acids shorter but appears to be derived from HrpA rather than HrpB.
