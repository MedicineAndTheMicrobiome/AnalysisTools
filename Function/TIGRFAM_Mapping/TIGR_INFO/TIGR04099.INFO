CC  Radical SAM family TIGR04043 is a marker for a widespread eight-gene probable biosynthetic cluster of unknown function. This protein family occurs only in the context of TIGR04043 member-containing biosynthetic clusters, although in a minority of such clusters. This protein family belongs to the TIGR04098 domain family, which also includes N-terminal domains of several probable polyketide synthases. A role in biosynthetic processes is suspected.
