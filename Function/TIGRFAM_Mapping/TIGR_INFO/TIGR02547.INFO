CC  CRISPR is a term for Clustered, Regularly Interspaced Short Palidromic Repeats. A number of protein families appear only in association with these repeats and are designated Cas (CRISPR-Associated) proteins. This HMM family, represented by CT1972 from Chlorobium tepidum, is found in Ecoli subtype CRISPR/Cas regions of many bacteria, most of which are mesophiles, and not in Archaea. It is designated Cse1.
