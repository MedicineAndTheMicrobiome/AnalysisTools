EN  thiazole biosynthesis enzyme
TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  This enzyme is involved in the biosynthesis of the thiamine precursor thiazole, and is repressed by thiamine. This family includes c-thi1, a Citrus gene induced during natural and ethylene induced fruit maturation and is highly homologous to plant and yeast thi genes involved in thiamine biosynthesis.
