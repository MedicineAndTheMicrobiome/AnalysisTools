CC  Most members of this family are phosphoglycerate mutase (EC 5.4.2.1). This enzyme interconverts 2-phosphoglycerate and 3-phosphoglycerate. The enzyme is transiently phosphorylated on an active site histidine by 2,3-diphosphoglyerate, which is both substrate and product.  Some members of this family have are phosphoglycerate mutase as a minor activity and act primarily as a bisphoglycerate mutase, interconverting 2,3-diphosphoglycerate and 1,3-diphosphoglycerate (EC 5.4.2.4). This HMM is designated as a subfamily for this reason. The second and third paralogs in S. cerevisiae are somewhat divergent and apparently inactive (see PUBMED:9544241) but are also part of this subfamily phylogenetically.
