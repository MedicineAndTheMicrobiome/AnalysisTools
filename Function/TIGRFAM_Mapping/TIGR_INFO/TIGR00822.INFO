CC  Bacterial PTS transporters transport and concomitantly phosphorylate their sugar substrates, and typically consist of multiple subunits or protein domains. The Man (PTS splinter group) family is unique in several respects among PTS permease families. It is the only PTS family in which members possess a IID protein. It is the only PTS family in which the IIB constituent is phosphorylated on a histidyl rather than a cysteyl residue. Its permease members exhibit broad specificity for a range of sugars, rather than being specific for just one or a few sugars. The mannose permease of E. coli, for example, can transport and phosphorylate glucose, mannose, fructose, glucosamine,N-acetylglucosamine, and other sugars. Other members of this family can transport sorbose, fructose and N-acetylglucosamine. This family is specific for the sorbose-specific IIC subunits of this family of PTS transporters.
