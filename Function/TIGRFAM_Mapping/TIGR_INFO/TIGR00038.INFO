CC  function: involved in peptide bond synthesis. stimulate efficient translation and peptide-bond synthesis on native or reconstituted 70S ribosomes in vitro. probably functions indirectly by altering the affinity of the ribosome for aminoacyl-tRNA, thus increasing their reactivity as acceptors for peptidyl transferase (by similarity). The trusted cutoff of this model is set high enough to exclude members of TIGR02178, an EFP-like protein of certain Gammaproteobacteria.
