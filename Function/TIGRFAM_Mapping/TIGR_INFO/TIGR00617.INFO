CC  All proteins in this family for which functions are known are part of a multiprotein complex made up of homologs of RPA1, RPA2 and RPA3 that bind ssDNA and function in the recognition of DNA damage for nucleotide excision repair
CC  This family is based on the phylogenomic analysis of JA Eisen (1999, Ph.D. Thesis, Stanford University).
