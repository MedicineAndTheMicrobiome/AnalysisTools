CC  Members of this protein family are extremely lineage-restricted, occurring exclusively in the Planctomycetes and Chlamydiae/Verrucomicrobia group, although not in Chlamydia itself. The function is unknown; the lack of invariant residues other than a single Phe suggests an ancient, conserved, non-enzymatic role.
