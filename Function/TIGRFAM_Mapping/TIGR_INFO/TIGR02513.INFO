CC  Members of this family include YscB of Yersinia and functionally equivalent (but differently named) proteins from type III secretion systems of other pathogens that affect animal cells. YscB acts, along with SycN (TIGR02503), as a chaperone for YopN, a key part of a complex that regulates type III secretion so it responds to contact with the eukaryotic target cell.
