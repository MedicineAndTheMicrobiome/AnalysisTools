CC  Members of this family are the RepB protein involved in replicon partitioning. RepB is found, in general, as part of a repABC operon in plasmids and small chromosomes, separate from the main chromosome, in various bacteria. This model describes a rather narrow clade of proteins; it should be noted that additional homologs scoring below the trusted cutoff have very similar functions, although they may be named differently.
