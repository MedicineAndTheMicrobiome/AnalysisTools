CC  This clade of the PF00155 superfamily of aminotransferases includes several which are adjacent to elements of the lysine biosynthesis via diaminopimelate pathway (GenProp0125).  This clade includes characterized species in plants and Chlamydia [1, 2].  Every member of this clade is from a genome which possesses most of the lysine biosynthesis pathway but lacks any of the known succinylases, desuccinylases, acetylases or deacetylases typical of the acylated versions of this pathway nor do they have the direct, NADPH-dependent enzyme (ddh).
