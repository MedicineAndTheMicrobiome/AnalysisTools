CC  Under osmotic stress, betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase oxidizes glycine betaine aldehyde into the osmoprotectant glycine betaine, via the second of two oxidation steps from exogenously supplied choline or betaine aldehyde. This choline-glycine betaine synthesis pathway can be found in gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
CC  In Escherichia coli, betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase (betB) is osmotically co-induced with choline dehydrogenase (betA) in the presence of choline. These dehydrogenases are located in a betaine gene cluster with the upstream choline transporter (betT) and transcriptional regulator (betI) [1]. 
CC  Similar to E.coli, betaine synthesis in Staphylococcus xylosus is also influenced by osmotic stress and the presence of choline with genes localized in a functionally equivalent gene cluster [2].
CC  Organization of the betaine gene cluster in Sinorhizobium meliloti and Bacillus subtilis differs from that of E.coli by the absence of upstream choline transporter and transcriptional regulator homologues [2,3]. Additionally, B.subtilis co-expresses a type II alcohol dehydrogenase with betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase instead of choline dehydrogenase as in E.coli, St.xylosus, and Si.meliloti [3].
CC  Betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase is a member of the aldehyde dehydrogenase family (PF00171).
