CC  This HMM represents a subfamily of proteins consisting of aconitase, homoaconitase, 3-isopropylmalate dehydratase, and uncharacterized proteins. The majority of the members of this family have been designated as 3-isopropylmalate dehydratase large subunit (LeuC) in microbial genome annotation, but the only characterized member is Thermus thermophilus homoaconitase, an enzyme of a non-aspartate pathway of Lys biosynthesis.
