CC  This HMM represents a family of proteins found immediately downstream of ribonucleotide reductase genes in Xyella fastidiosa and some Gram-positive bacteria. It appears to be a highly divergent flavodoxin of the short chain type, more like the flavodoxins of the sulfate-reducing genus Desulfovibrio than like the NifF flavodoxins associated with nitrogen fixation.
