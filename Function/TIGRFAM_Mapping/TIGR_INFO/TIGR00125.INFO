CC  Protein families that contain at least one copy of this domain include citrate lyase ligase, pantoate-beta-alanine ligase, glycerol-3-phosphate cytidyltransferase, ADP-heptose synthase, phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase, lipopolysaccharide core biosynthesis protein KdtB, the bifunctional protein NadR, and a number whose function is unknown. Many of these proteins are known to use CTP or ATP and release pyrophosphate.
