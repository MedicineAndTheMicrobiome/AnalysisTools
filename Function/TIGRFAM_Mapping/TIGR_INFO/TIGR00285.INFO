CC  Alba has been shown to bind DNA and affect DNA supercoiling in a temperature dependent manner. It is regulated by acetylation (alba = acetylation lowers binding affinity) by the Sir2 protein. Alba is proposed to play a role in establishment or maintenace of chromatin architecture and thereby in transcription repression.  
CC  This protein appears so far only in the Archaea, but may be universal there. There is a single member in three of the first four completed archaeal genomes, and a second copy in A. fulgidus. In Sulfolobus shibatae there is a tandem second copy that is poorly conserved and scores below the trusted cutoff; all other members of the family are conserved at greater than 50 % pairwise identity.
