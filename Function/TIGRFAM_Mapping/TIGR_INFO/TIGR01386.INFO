CC  Members of this family contain a sensor histidine kinase domain (Pfam:PF00512) and a domain found in bacterial signal proteins (Pfam:PF00672). This group is separated phylogenetically from related proteins with similar architecture and contains a number of proteins associated with heavy metal resistance efflux systems for copper, silver, cadmium, and/or zinc.
