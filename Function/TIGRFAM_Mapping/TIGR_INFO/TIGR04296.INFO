CC  This putative protein sorting/processing domain occurs about ten times per genome in members of the Thaumarchaeota. Its putative handling protein, a member of the archaeosortase/exosortase protein family, is exceptional in having a Ser rather than Cys at the putative active site. The highly conserved motif resembles the PEF-CTERM protein sorting domain of family TIGR03024, but membership does not overlap.
