TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  Several related protein families encode outer membrane pore proteins for type II secretion, type III secretion, and type IV pilus formation. This protein family appears to encode a secretin for pilus formation, although it is quite different from PilQ. Members include the PilN lipoprotein of the plasmid R64 thin pilus, a type IV pilus. Scoring between the trusted and noise cutoffs are examples of bundle-forming pilus B (bfpB).
