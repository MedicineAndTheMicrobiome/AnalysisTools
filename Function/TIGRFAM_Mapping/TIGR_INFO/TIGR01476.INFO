CC  This HMM describes a subfamily of a large family of polyprenyltransferases (PF01040) that also includes 4-hydroxybenzoate octaprenyltransferase and protoheme IX farnesyltransferase (heme O synthase). Members of this family are found exclusively in photosynthetic organisms, including a single copy in Arabidopsis thaliana.
