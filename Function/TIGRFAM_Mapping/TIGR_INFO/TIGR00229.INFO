CC  The PAS domain was previously described. This sensory box, or S-box domain occupies the central portion of the PAS domain but is more widely distributed.  It is often tandemly repeated. Known prosthetic groups bound in the S-box domain include heme in the oxygen sensor FixL, FAD in the redox potential sensor NifL, and a 4-hydroxycinnamyl chromophore in photoactive yellow protein. Proteins containing the domain often contain other regulatory domains such as response regulator or sensor histidine kinase domains. Other S-box proteins include phytochromes and the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator.
