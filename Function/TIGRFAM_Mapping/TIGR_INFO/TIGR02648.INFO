CC  Members of this protein family are found on the main chromosomes of a number of the Gammaproteobacteria; this model excludes related plasmid proteins, which score between trusted and noise cutoffs. This protein, DNA replication terminus site-binding protein, binds specific DNA sites near the replication terminus to arrest the DNA replication fork.
