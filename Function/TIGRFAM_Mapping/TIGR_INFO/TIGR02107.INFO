CC  This HMM describes a very small protein, coenzyme PQQ biosynthesis protein A, which is smaller than 25 amino acids in many species. It is proposed to serve as a peptide precursor of coenzyme pyrrolo-quinoline-quinone (PQQ), with Glu and Tyr of a conserved motif Glu-Xxx-Xxx-Xxx-Tyr becoming part of the product.
RM  9467911
RT  pqqA is not required for biosynthesis of pyrroloquinoline quinone in Methylobacterium extorquens AM1.
