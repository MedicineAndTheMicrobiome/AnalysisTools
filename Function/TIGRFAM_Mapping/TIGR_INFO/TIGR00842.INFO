CC  The Betaine/Carnitine/Choline Transporter (BCCT) Family (TC 2.A.15)
CC  Proteins of the BCCT family share the common functional feature of transporting molecules with a quaternary ammonium group [R-N+(CH3)3]. The BCCT family includes transporters for carnitine, choline and glycine betaine. BCCT transporters have 12 putative TMS, and are energized by pmf-driven proton symport. Some of these permeases exhibit osmosensory and osmoregulatory
CC  properties inherent to their polypeptide chains.
