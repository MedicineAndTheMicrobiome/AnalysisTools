CC  This HMM represents a proteobacterial histidine utilization repressor. It is usually found clustered with the enzymes HutUHIG so that it can regulate its own expression as well. A number of species have several paralogs and may fine-tune the regulation according to levels of degradation intermediates such as urocanate. This family belongs to the larger GntR family of transcriptional regulators.
