CC  This model represents a family of corrin and 8-iron Fe-S cluster-containing reductive dehalogenases [1] found primarily in halorespiring microorganisms such as dehalococcoides ethenogenes which contains as many as 17 enzymes of this type with varying substrate ranges.  One example of a characterized species is the tetrachloroethene reductive dehalogenase [2] (1.97.1.8) which also acts on trichloroethene converting it to dichloroethene.
