CC  This HMM describes the whole, except for a 60 residue N-terminal helix-turn-helix DNA-binding domain (PFAM PF01381) of the family of proteins related to the transcriptional regulator Rgg, also called RopB. Rgg is required for secretion of several proteins, including a cysteine proteinase associated with virulence. GadR (GP|2352485) is a positive regulator of a glutamate-dependent acid resistance mechanism. MutR is a transcriptional activator for mutacin biosynthesis genes in Streptococcus mutans. This family appears restricted to the low-GC Gram-positive bacteria, including at least eight members in Lactococcus lactis.
