CC  Members of this family show a distant relationship by PSI-BLAST to alpha/beta (TIM) barrel enzymes such as dihydroorotate dehydrogenase and glycolate oxidase. At least two closely related but well-separable families among the bacteria, the nifR3/yhdG family and the yjbN family, share a more distant relationship to this family of shorter, exclusively archaeal proteins.
