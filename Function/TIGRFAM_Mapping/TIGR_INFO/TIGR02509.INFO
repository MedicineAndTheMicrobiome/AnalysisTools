TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  Members of this family are type III secretion system effectors, named differently in different species and designated YopR (Yersinia outer protein R), encoded by the YscH (Yersinia secretion H) gene. This Yops protein is unusual in that it is released to extracellularly rather than injected directly into the target cell as are most Yops.
