CC  This model represents a shared N-terminal domain, about 43 amino acids in length, common to a number of related protein families each of which is associated with a distinct subtype of CRISPR/cas system, where CRISPR is an acronym for Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeat and Cas is an abbreviation for CRISPR-associated. Members of this family are widely distributed enough that we designated the family Cas5. Homology appears remote, or absent, between the more C-terminal regions different subfamilies of these proteins, which typically are 210 to 265 amino acids in total length. Cas5 proteins of six different CRISPR/cas subtypes so far defined are described by respective full-length models  TIGR01868, TIGR01876, TIGR01895, TIGR01874, TIGR02586, and TIGR02592. The best characterized protein in this family is DevS or Myxococcus xanthus, a Cas protein that appears to participate in a species-specific developmental pathway.
