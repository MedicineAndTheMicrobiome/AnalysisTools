CC  Members of this model form a distinct subset of the larger family of oxidoreductases that includes zinc-binding alcohol dehydrogenases and NADPH:quinone reductases (PF00107). The gene neighborhood of members of this family is not conserved and it appears that no members are characterized. The sequence of the family includes 6 invariant cysteine residues and one invariant histidine. It appears that no member is characterized.
