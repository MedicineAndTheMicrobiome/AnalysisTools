CC  The opcA gene is found immediately downstream of zwf, the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) gene, in a number of species, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Streptomyces coelicolor, Nostoc punctiforme, and Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942. In the latter, disruption of opcA was shown to block assembly of G6PDH into active oligomeric forms.
