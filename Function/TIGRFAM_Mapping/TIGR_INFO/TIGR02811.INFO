CC  Members of this uncharacterized protein family are all small, extending 70 or fewer residues from their respective likely start codons. All have the twin-arginine-dependent tranport (TAT) signal sequence at the N-terminus and a conserved 20-residue C-terminal region that includes the motif Y-[HRK]-X-[TS]-X-H-[IV]-X-X-[YF]-Y. The TAT signal sequence suggests a bound cofactor. All members are encoded near genes for subunits of formate dehydrogenase, and may themselves be a subunit or accessory protein.
