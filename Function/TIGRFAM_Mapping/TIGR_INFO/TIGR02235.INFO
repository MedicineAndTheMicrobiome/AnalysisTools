CC  This family of phytyltransferases, found in plants and cyanobacteria, are involved in the biosythesis of phylloquinone (Vitamin K1).  Phylloquinone is a critical component of photosystem I [1].  The closely related MenA enzyme from bacteria transfers a prenyl group (which only differs in the saturation of the isoprenyl groups) in the biosynthesis of menaquinone.  Activity towards both substrates in certain organisms should be considered a possibility.
