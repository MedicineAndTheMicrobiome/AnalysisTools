CC  This family consists of D-serine ammonia-lyase (EC 4.3.1.18), a pyridoxal-phosphate enzyme that converts D-serine to pyruvate and NH3. This  enzyme is also called D-serine dehydratase and D-serine deaminase and was previously designated EC 4.2.1.14. It is homologous to an enzyme that acts on threonine and may itself act weakly on threonine.
