CC  This HMM describes a domain of unknown function that is found in the predicted extracellular domain of a number of putative membrane-bound proteins. One of these is proteins psr, described as a penicillin binding protein 5 (PDP-5) synthesis repressor. Another is Bacillus subtilis LytR, described as a transcriptional attenuator of itself and the LytABC operon, where LytC is N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase. A third is CpsA, a putative regulatory protein involved in exocellular polysaccharide biosynthesis. Besides the region of strong similarily represented by this HMM, these proteins share the property of having a short putative N-terminal cytoplasmic domain and transmembrane domain forming a signal-anchor.
