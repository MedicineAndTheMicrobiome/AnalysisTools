CC  This HMM describes MoaD. It excludes archaeal homologs, since many Archaea have two MoaD-like proteins, suggesting two different functions. The Pfam HMM PF02597 describes both the thiamine biosynthesis protein ThiS and this protein, MoaD, a subunit (together with MoaE, Pfam:PF02391) of the molybdopterin converting factor. Both ThiS and MoaD are involved in sulfur transfer reactions. Distribution of this family appears limited to species that also have a member of PF02391, but a number of Archaea have two different members, suggesting functionally distinct subtypes.
CC  The C-terminal Gly-Gly of this model is critical to function.
