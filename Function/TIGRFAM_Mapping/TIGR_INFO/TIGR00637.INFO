CC  ModE is a molybdate-activated repressor of the molybdate transport operon in E. coli. It consists of the domain represented by this HMM and two tandem copies of mop-like domain, where Mop proteins are a family of 68-residue molybdenum-pterin binding proteins of Clostridium pasteurianum. This HMM also represents the full length of a pair of archaeal proteins that lack Mop-like domains. PSI-BLAST analysis shows similarity to helix-turn-helix regulatory proteins.
