CC  Members of this protein family are part of the machinery of bacterial type III secretion in a number of bacteria that target animal cells. In the well-studied system from Yersinia, a complex of this protein (SycN) and YscB (PF07329) acts as a chaperone for the export of YopN (PMID:10094626). YopN then acts to control effector protein secretion, in response to calcium levels, so that secretion occurs only after contact with the targeted eukaryotic cell.
