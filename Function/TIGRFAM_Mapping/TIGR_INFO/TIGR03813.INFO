CC  Members of this protein family are putative putative glutamate/gamma-aminobutyrate antiporters. Each member of the seed alignment is found adjacent to a glutamate decarboxylase, which converts glutamate (Glu) to gamma-aminobutyrate (GABA). However, the majority belong to genome contexts with a glutaminase (converts Gln to Glu) as well as the decarboxylase that converts Glu to GABA. The specificity of the transporter remains uncertain.
