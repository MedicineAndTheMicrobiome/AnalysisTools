CC  Phosphonates are a class of phosphorus-containing organic compound with a stable direct C-P bond rather than a C-O-P linkage. A number of bacterial species have operons, typically about 14 genes in size, with genes for ATP-dependent transport of phosphonates, degradation, and regulation of the expression of the system. Members of this protein family are the ATP-binding cassette component of tripartite ABC transporters of phosphonates.
