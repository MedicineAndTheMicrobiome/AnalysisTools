CC  Alternate names: phosphatidylglycerophosphate synthase; glycerophosphate phosphatidyltransferase; PGP synthase. A number of related enzymes are quite similar in both sequence and catalytic activity, including Saccharamyces cerevisiae YDL142c, now known to be a cardiolipin synthase. There may be problems with incorrect transitive annotation of near homologs as authentic CDP-diacylglycerol--glycerol-3-phosphate 3-phosphatidyltransferase.
