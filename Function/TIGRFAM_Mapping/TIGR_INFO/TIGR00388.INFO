CC  This tetrameric form of glycyl-tRNA synthetase (2 alpha, 2 beta) is found in the majority of completed eubacterial genomes, with the two genes fused in a few species. A substantially different homodimeric form (not recognized by this model) replaces this form in the Archaea, animals, yeasts, and some eubacteria.
