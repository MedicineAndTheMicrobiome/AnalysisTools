CC  Members of this protein family occur in conserved genomic contexts highly suggestive of lipid biosynthesis, including an island shared between Kuenenia stuttgartiensis, which produces ladderanes, and Desulfotalea psychrophila, which produces a different kind of unusual polyunsaturated hydrocarbon.
