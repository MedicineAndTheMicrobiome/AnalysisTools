CC  This model describes a predicted membrane subunit, DevC, of an ABC transporter known so far from two species of cyanobacteria. Some experimental data from mutational analysis suggest that this protein along with DevA and DevB encoded in the same operon may be involved in the transport/export of glycolipids.
