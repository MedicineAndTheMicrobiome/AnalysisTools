CC  Peptide deformylase (EC 3.5.1.88), also called polypeptide deformylase, is a metalloenzyme that uses water to release formate from the N-terminal formyl-L-methionine of bacterial and chloroplast peptides. This enzyme should not be confused with formylmethionine deformylase (EC 3.5.1.31) which is active on free N-formyl methionine and has been reported from rat intestine.
