EN  type III secretion apparatus protein OrgA/MxiK
TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  This gene is found in type III secretion operons and has been shown to be essential for the invasion phenotype in Salmonella and a component of the secretion apparatus [1].  The protein is known as OrgA in Salmonella due to its oxygen-dependent expression pattern in which low-oxygen levels up-regulate the gene [2].  In Shigella the ghene is called MxiK and has been shown to be sessential for the proper assembly of the secretion needle complex [3].
