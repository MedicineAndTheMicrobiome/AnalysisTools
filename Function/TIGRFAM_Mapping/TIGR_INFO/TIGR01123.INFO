CC  Among the class IV aminotransferases are two phylogenetically separable groups of branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase (IlvE). The last common ancestor of the two lineages appears also to have given rise to a family of D-amino acid aminotransferases (DAAT). This model represents the IlvE family less similar to the DAAT family.
