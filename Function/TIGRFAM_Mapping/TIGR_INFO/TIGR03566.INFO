CC  Members of this protein family use NAD(P)H to reduce FMN and regenerate FMNH2. Members include the NADH-dependent enzyme MsuE from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which serves as a partner to an FMNH2-dependent alkanesulfonate monooxygenase. The NADP-dependent enzyme from E. coli is outside the scope of this model.
