CC  This HMM describes a paralogous family of hypothetical proteins in Arabidopsis thaliana. No homologs are detected from other species. Length heterogeneity within the family is attributable partly to a 21-residue repeat present in from zero to three tandem copies. The central region of the repeat resembles the pattern [VIF][FY][QK]GX[LM]P[DEK]XXXDDAL.
