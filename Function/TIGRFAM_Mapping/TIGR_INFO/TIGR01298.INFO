CC  This HMM describes ribonuclease T, an enzyme found so far only
CC  in gamma-subdivision Proteobacteria such as Escherichia coli and Xylella fastidiosa. Ribonuclease T is homologous to the DNA polymerase III alpha chain. It can liberate AMP from the common C-C-A terminus of uncharged tRNA. It appears also to be involved in RNA maturation. It also acts as a 3' to 5' single-strand DNA-specific exonuclease; it is distinctive for its ability to remove residues near a double-stranded stem.  Ribonuclease T is a high copy suppressor in E. coli of a uv-repair defect caused by deletion of three other single-stranded DNA exonucleases.
