CC  This HMM represents precorrin-3B C17-methyltransferase, one of two methyltransferases commonly referred to as precorrin-3 methylase (the other is precorrin-4 C11-methyltransferase, EC 2.1.1.133). This enzyme participates in the pathway toward the biosynthesis of cobalamin and related products. Members of this family may appear as fusion proteins with other enzymes of cobalamin biosynthesis.
