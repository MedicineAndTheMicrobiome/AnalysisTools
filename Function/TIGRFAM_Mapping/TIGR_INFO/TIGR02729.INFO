CC  This model describes a univeral, mostly one-gene-per-genome GTP-binding protein that associates with ribosomal subunits and appears to play a role in ribosomal RNA maturation. This GTPase, related to the nucleolar protein Obg, is designated CgtA in bacteria. Mutations in this gene are pleiotropic, but it appears that effects on cellular functions such as chromosome partition may be secondary to the effect on ribosome structure. Recent work done in Vibrio cholerae shows an essential role in the stringent response, in which RelA-dependent ability to synthesize the alarmone ppGpp is required for deletion of this GTPase to be lethal.
