CC  This HMM represents the rifin branch of the rifin/stevor family (PF02009) of predicted variant surface antigens as found in Plasmodium falciparum. This model is based on a set of rifin sequences kindly provided by Matt Berriman from the Sanger Center. This is a global model and assesses a penalty for incomplete sequence. Additional fragmentary sequences may be found with the fragment model and a cutoff of 20 bits.
