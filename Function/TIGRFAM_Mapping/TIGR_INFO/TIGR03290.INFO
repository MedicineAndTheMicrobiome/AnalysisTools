CC  The last step in methanogenesis leaves two coenzymes of methanogenesis, CoM and CoB, linked by a disulfide bond. Members of this protein family are the C subunit of the enzyme that reduces the heterodisulfide to CoB-SH and CoM-SH. Similar enzyme complex subunits are found in various other species, but likely act on a different substrate.
