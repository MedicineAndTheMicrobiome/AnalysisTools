CC  This HMM represents the alpha chain of the vanadium-containing component of the vanadium-iron nitrogenase compound I.  The complex also includes a second alpha chain, two beta chains and two delta chains.  Compount I interacts with compound II also known as the iron-protein which transfers electrons to compound I where the catalysis occurs.
