CC  This HMM describes a subfamily of ABC transporter permease subunits. One member of this family has been associated with the toluene tolerance phenotype of Pseudomonas putida, another with L-glutamate transport, another with maintenance of lipid asymmetry. Many bacterial species have one or two members. The Mycobacteria have large paralogous families included in the DUF140 family but excluded from this subfamily on based on extreme divergence at the amino end and on phylogenetic and UPGMA trees on the more conserved regions.
