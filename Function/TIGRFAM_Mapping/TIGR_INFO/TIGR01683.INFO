CC  This HMM represents ThiS, a small, ubiquitin-like thiamine biosynthesis protein related to MoaD, a molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis protein. Both proteins are involved in sulfur transfer. ThiS has a conserved Gly-Gly C-terminus that is modified, in reactions requiring ThiI, ThiF, IscS, and a sulfur atom from Cys, into the thiocarboxylate that provides the sulfur for thiazole biosynthesis.

RT  The iscS gene in Escherichia coli is required for the biosynthesis of 4-thiouridine, thiamin, and NAD.
