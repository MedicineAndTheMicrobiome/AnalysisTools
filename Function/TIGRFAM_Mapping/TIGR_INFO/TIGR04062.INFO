CC  A DNA sulfur modification system, dnd (degradation during electrophoresis), is sparsely and sporadically distributed among the bacteria. Members of this protein fam
CC  ily are strictly limited to species with the dnd operon, and are found close to the dnd operon on the chromosomes of species such as Nostoc sp. PCC 7120, Geobacter uraniireducens Rf4, and Roseobacter denitrificans OCh 114.
