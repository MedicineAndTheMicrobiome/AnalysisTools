CC  This enzyme interconverts L-alanine and D-alanine. Its primary function is to generate D-alanine for cell wall formation. With D-alanine-D-alanine ligase, it makes up the D-alanine branch of the peptidoglycan biosynthetic route. It is a monomer with one pyridoxal phosphate per subunit. In E. coli, the ortholog is duplicated so that a second isozyme, DadX, is present. DadX, a paralog of the biosynthetic Alr, is induced by D- or L-alanine and is involved in catabolism.
