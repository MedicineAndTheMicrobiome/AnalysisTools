CC  Members of this are family are a B12-binding domain/radical SAM domain protein required for 3-methylhopanoid production. Activity was confirmed by mutant phenotype by disrupting this gene in Methylococcus capsulatus strain Bath. This protein family should only occur in genomes that encode a squalene-hopene cyclase (see TIGR01507).
