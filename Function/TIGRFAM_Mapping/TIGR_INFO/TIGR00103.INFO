EN  DNA-binding protein, YbaB/EbfC family
TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  The function of this protein is unknown, but it has been expressed and crystallized. Its gene nearly always occurs next to recR and/or dnaX. It is restricted to Bacteria and the plant Arabidopsis. The plant form contains an additional N-terminal region that may serve as a transit peptide and shows a close relationship to the cyanobacterial member, suggesting that it is a chloroplast protein. Members of this family are found in a single copy per bacterial genome, but are broadly distributed. A member is present even in the minimal gene complement of Mycoplasm genitalium.
