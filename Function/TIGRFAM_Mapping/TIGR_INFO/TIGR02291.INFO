CC  Members of this protein family contain a region of homology to the RimK family of alpha-L-glutamate ligases (TIGR00768), various members of which modify the Glu-Glu C-terminus of ribosomal protein S6, or tetrahydromethanopterin, or a form of coenzyme F420 derivative. Members of this family are found so far in various Vibrio and Pseudomonas species and some other gamma and beta Proteobacteria. The function is unknown.
