CC  These proteins are members of the C4-dicarboxylate Uptake C (DcuC) Family (TC 2.A.61). The only functionally characterized member of this family is the anaerobic C4-dicarboxylate transporter (DcuC) of Escherichia coli. DcuC has 12 GES predicted transmembrane regions, is induced only under anaerobic conditions, and is not repressed by glucose. It may therefore function as a succinate efflux system during anaerobic glucose fermentation. However, when overexpressed, it can replace either DcuA or DcuB in
CC  catalyzing fumarate-succinate exchange and fumarate uptake.
