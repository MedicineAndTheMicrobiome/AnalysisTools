CC  This model represents the all-iron variant of the nitrogenase component I alpha chain.  Molybdenum-iron and vanadium iron forms are also found.  The complete complex contains two alpha chains, two beta chains and two delta chains.  The component I associates with component II also known as the iron protein which serves to provide electrons for component I.
