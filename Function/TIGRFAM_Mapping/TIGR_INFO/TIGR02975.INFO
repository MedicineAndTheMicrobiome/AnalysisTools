CC  This protein previously was designated yjbO in E. coli. It is found only in genomes that have the phage shock operon (psp), but only rarely is encoded near other psp genes. The psp regulon is upregulated in response to a number of stress conditions, including ethanol, expression of the filamentous phage secretin protein IV and other secretins, and heat shock.
