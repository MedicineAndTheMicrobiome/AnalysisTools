CC  This HMM describes a domain found in PilB, a protein important for pilin expression, N-terminal to a domain coextensive to with the known peptide methionine sulfoxide reductase (MsrA), a protein repair enzyme, of E. coli. Among the early completed genomes, this module is found if and only if MsrA is also found, whether N-terminal to MsrA (as for Helicobacter pylori), C-terminal (as for Treponema pallidum), or in a separate polypeptide. Although the function of this region is not clear, an auxiliary function to MsrA is suggested.
