CC  Members of this protein family are integral proteins of the bacterial outer membrane, associated with multiheme c-type cytochromes involved in electron transfer. The MtrB protein of Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 (SO1776) has been shown to form a complex with 1:1:1 stochiometry with the small, periplasmic decaheme cytochrome MtrA and large, surface-exposed decaheme cytochrome MtrC.
