CC  The methionyl-tRNA synthetase (metG) is a class I amino acyl-tRNA ligase. This HMM describes a region of the methionyl-tRNA synthetase that is present at the C-terminus of MetG in some species (E. coli, B. subtilis, Thermotoga maritima, Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum), and as a separate beta chain in Aquifex aeolicus. It is absent in a number of other species (e.g. Mycoplasma genitalium, Mycobacterium tuberculosis), while Pyrococcus horikoshii has both a full length MetG and a second protein homologous to the beta chain only. Proteins hit by this HMM should called methionyl-tRNA synthetase beta chain if and only if the HMM metG hits a separate protein not also hit by this HMM.
