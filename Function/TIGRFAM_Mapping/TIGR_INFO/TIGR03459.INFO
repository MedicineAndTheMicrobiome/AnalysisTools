CC  This model represents a family of hydrophobic and presumed membrane proteins found in the Actinobacteria.  The genes encoding these proteins are syntenically associated with (found proximal to) genes of carotene biosynthesis ususally including phytoene synthase (crtB), phytoene dehydrogenase (crtI) and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase (ispA).
