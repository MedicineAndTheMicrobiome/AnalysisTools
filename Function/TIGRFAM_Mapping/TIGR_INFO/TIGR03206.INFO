CC  Members of this protein family are the enzyme 2-hydroxycyclohexanecarboxyl-CoA dehydrogenase. The enzymatic properties were confirmed experimentally in Rhodopseudomonas palustris; the enzyme is homotetrameric, and not sensitive to oxygen. This enzyme is part of proposed pathway for degradation of benzoyl-CoA to 3-hydroxypimeloyl-CoA that differs from the analogous in Thauera aromatica. It also may occur in degradation of the non-aromatic compound cyclohexane-1-carboxylate.
