CC  Maleylacetoacetate isomerase is an enzyme of tyrosine and phenylalanine catabolism. It requires glutathione and belongs by homology to the zeta family of glutathione S-transferases. The enzyme (EC 5.2.1.2) is described as active also on maleylpyruvate, and the example from a Ralstonia sp. catabolic plasmid is described as a maleylpyruvate isomerase involved in gentisate catabolism.
