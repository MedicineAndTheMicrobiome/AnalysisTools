CC  Members of this protein family are 6-oxocyclohex-1-ene-1-carbonyl-CoA hydrolase, a ring-hydrolyzing enzyme in the anaerobic metabolism of aromatic enzymes by way of benzoyl-CoA, as seen in Thauera aromatica, Geobacter metallireducens, and Azoarcus sp. Note that Rhodopseudomonas palustris uses a different pathway to perform a similar degradation of benzoyl-CoA to 3-hydroxpimelyl-CoA.
