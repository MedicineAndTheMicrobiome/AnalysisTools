CC  All proteins in this family for which functions are known are DNA-photolyases used for the direct repair of UV irradiation induced DNA damage.  Some repair 6-4 photoproducts while others repair cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers. This family is based on the phylogenomic analysis of JA Eisen (1999, Ph.D. Thesis, Stanford University).
