CC  Members of this archaeal protein family resemble periplasmic substrate-binding proteins of ABC transporters and appear in gene neighborhoods with permease and ATP-binding cassette proteins. Notably, essentially all members also have the PGF-CTERM putative protein-sorting domain at the C-terminus, while more distant homologs (excluded by the trusted cutoff) instead have what appear to be lipoprotein signal peptides at the N-terminus.
