CC  The enzyme activities methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (EC 1.5.1.20) and  5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (FADH) (EC 1.7.99.5) differ in that 1.5.1.20 (assigned in many eukaryotes) is defined to use NADP+ as an acceptor, while 1.7.99.5 (assigned in many bacteria) is flexible with respect to the acceptor; both convert 5-methyltetrahydrofolate to 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate. From a larger set of proteins assigned as 1.5.1.20 and 1.7.99.5, this model describes the subset of proteins found in bacteria, and currently designated 1.7.99.5.
CC  This protein is an FAD-containing flavoprotein.
