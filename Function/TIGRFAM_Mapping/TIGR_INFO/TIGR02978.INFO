CC  All members of this protein family are the phage shock protein PspC. These proteins contain a PspC domain, as do other members of the larger family of proteins described by Pfam model PF04024. The phage shock regulon is restricted to the Proteobacteria and somewhat sparsely distributed there. It is expressed, under positive control of a sigma-54-dependent transcription factor, PspF, which binds and is modulated by PspA. Stresses that induce the psp regulon include phage secretin overexpression, ethanol, heat shock, and protein export defects.
