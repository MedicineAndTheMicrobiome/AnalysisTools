CC  Members of this protein family are the CitX protein, or CitX domain of the CitXG bifunctional protein, of the citrate lyase system. CitX transfers the prosthetic group 2'-(5''-triphosphoribosyl)-3'-dephospho-CoA to the citrate lyase gamma chain, an acyl carrier protein. This enzyme may be designated holo-ACP synthase, holo-citrate lyase synthase, or apo-citrate lyase phosphoribosyl-dephospho-CoA transferase. In a few genera, including Haemophilus, this protein occurs as a fusion protein with CitG (2.7.8.25), an enzyme involved in prosthetic group biosynthesis. This CitX family is easily separated from the holo-ACP synthases of other enzyme systems.
