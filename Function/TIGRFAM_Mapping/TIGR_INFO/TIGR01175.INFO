CC  This protein is required for the assembly of the type IV fimbria in Pseudomonas aeruginosa responsible for twitching motility, and for a similar pilus-like structure in Synechocystis. It is also found in species such as Deinococcus described as having natural transformation (for which a type IV pilus-like structure is proposed) but not fimbria.
