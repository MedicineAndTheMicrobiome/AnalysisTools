CC  Many Gram-negative bacteria have a protein closely homologous to the C-terminal region of lysyl-tRNA synthetase (LysS). Multiple sequence alignment of these proteins with the homologous regions of collected LysS proteins shows that these proteins form a distinct set rather than just similar truncations of LysS. The protein is termed GenX after its designation in E. coli. Interestingly, genX often is located near a homolog of lysine-2,3-aminomutase.  Its function is unknown.
