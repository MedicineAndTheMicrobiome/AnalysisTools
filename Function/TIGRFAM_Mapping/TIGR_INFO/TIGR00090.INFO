CC  This model describes a widely distributed family of bacterial proteins related to iojap from plants. It includes RsfS(YbeB) from E. coli. The gene iojap is a pattern-striping gene in maize, reflecting a chloroplast development defect in some cells. The conserved function of this protein is to silence ribosomes by binding the ribosomal large subunit and impairing joining with the small subunit in response to nutrient stress. Note that RsfS (starvation) is an author-endorsed change from the published symbol RsfA, which conflicted with previously published gene symbols.
