CC  This enzyme may transfer a nucleotide, or it sugar moiety, as part of a biosynthetic pathway. Other proposed members of the pathway include another transferase (TIGR04282), a phosphoesterase, and a radical SAM enzyme (TIGR04167) whose C-terminal domain (PF12345) frequently contains a selenocysteine.
