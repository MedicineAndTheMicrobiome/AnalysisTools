CC  This gene is one of the glycosyl transferases involved in the biosynthesis of colanic acid, an exopolysaccharide expressed in Enterobacteraceae species [1].  This acetyltransferase is believed to catalyze the addition of the acetyl group that is attached through an O linkage to the first fucosyl residue of the colanic acid repetitive unit (E unit)
