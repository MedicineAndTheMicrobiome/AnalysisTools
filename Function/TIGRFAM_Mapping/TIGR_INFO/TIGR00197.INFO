CC  The protein region corresponding to this HMM shows no clear homology to any protein of known function.
CC  This HMM is built on yeast protein YNL200C and the N-terminal regions of E. coli yjeF and its orthologs in various species. The C-terminal region of yjeF and its orthologs shows similarity to hydroxyethylthiazole kinase (thiM) and other enzymes involved in thiamine biosynthesis. Yeast YKL151C and B. subtilis yxkO match the yjeF C-terminal domain but lack this region.
