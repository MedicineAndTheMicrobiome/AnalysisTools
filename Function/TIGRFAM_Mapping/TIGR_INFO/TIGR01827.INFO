CC  This HMM represents a family small family related to GatC, the third subunit of an enzyme for completing the charging of tRNA(Gln) by amidating the Glu-tRNA(Gln). The few known archaea that contain a member of this family appear to produce Asn-tRNA(Asn) by an analogous amidotransferase reaction. This protein is proposed to substitute for GatC in the charging of both tRNAs.
