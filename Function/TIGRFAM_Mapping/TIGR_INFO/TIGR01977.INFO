CC  This HMM describes a subfamily of probable pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enzymes in the aminotransferase class V family. Related families contain members active as cysteine desulfurases, selenocysteine lyases, or both. The members of this family form a distinct clade and all are shorter at the N-terminus. The function of this subfamily is unknown.
