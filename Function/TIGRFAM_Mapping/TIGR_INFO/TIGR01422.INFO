CC  This enzyme catalyzes the cleavage of the carbon phosphorous bond of a phosphonate.  The mechanism depends on the substrate having a carbonyl one carbon away from the cleavage position.  
CC  This enzyme is a member of the Haloacid Dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily of aspartate-nucleophile hydrolases (PF00702), and contains a modified version of the conserved catalytic motifs of that superfamily: the first motif is usually DxDx(T/V), here it is DxAxT, and in the third motif the normal conserved lysine is instead an arginine.  Additionally, the enzyme contains a unique conserved catalytic lysine (B. cereus pos. 53) which is involved in the binding and activation of the substrate through the formation of a Schiff base.  The substrate of this enzyme is the product of 2-aminoethylphosphonate (AEP) transaminase, phosphonoacetaldehyde.  This degradation pathway for AEP may be related to its toxic properties which are utilized by microorganisms as a chemical warfare agent.
