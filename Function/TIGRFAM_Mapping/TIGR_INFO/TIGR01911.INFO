CC  This HMM represents a family of small proteins related to HesB and its close homologs, which are likely to be invovlved in iron-sulfur cluster assembly (See TIGR00049 and PF01521). Several members are selenoproteins, with a TGA codon and Sec residue that aligns to the conserved Cys of the HesB domain. A variable Cys/Ser/Gly-rich C-terminal region is not included in the seed alignment and model.
