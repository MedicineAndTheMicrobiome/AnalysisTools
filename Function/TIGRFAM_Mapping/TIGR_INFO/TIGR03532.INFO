CC  This enzyme is part of the diaminopimelate pathway of lysine biosynthesis.
CC  Alternate name: tetrahydrodipicolinate N-acetyltransferase.  Note that IUBMB lists this alternate name as the accepted name.  Unfortunately, the related succinyl transferase acting on the same substrate (EC:2.3.1.117, TIGR00695) uses the opposite standard.  We have decided to give these two enzymes names which more clearly indicated that they act on the same substrate.
