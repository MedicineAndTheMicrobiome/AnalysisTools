CC  CRISPR is a term for Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palidromic Repeats. A number of protein families appear only in association with these repeats and are designated Cas (CRISPR associated) proteins. This family is represented by TM1800 from Thermotoga maritima. It is related to TIGR01868 (CRISPR-associated protein, CT1976 family).
