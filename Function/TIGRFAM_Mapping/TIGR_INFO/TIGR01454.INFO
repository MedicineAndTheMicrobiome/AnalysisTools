CC  The enzymes in this equivalog are all located in the operons for the  biosynthesis of 3-amino-5-hydroxybenoic acid (AHBA), which is a precursor of several antibiotics including ansatrienin [1], naphthomycin [1], rifamycin [2] and mitomycin [3].  The role that this enzyme plays in this biosynthesis has not been elucidated.
CC  This enzyme is a member of the Haloacid dehalogenase superfamily (PF00702) of aspartate-nucleophile hydrolases.
CC  This enzyme is closely related to phosphoglycolate phosphatase (TIGR01449), but it is unclear what purpose a PGPase or PGPase-like activity would serve in these biosyntheses.
CC  This model is limited to the Gram positive Actinobacteria.
CC  The most closely related enzyme below the noise cutoff is IndB which is involved in the biosynthesis of Indigoidine in Pectobacterium (Erwinia) chrysanthemi, a gamma proteobacter [4]. This enzyme is similarly related to PGP.  In this case, too it is unclear what role would be be played by a PGPase activity.
