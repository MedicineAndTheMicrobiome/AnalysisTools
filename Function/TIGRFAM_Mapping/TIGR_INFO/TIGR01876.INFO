CC  CRISPR is a term for Clustered, Regularly Interspaced Short Palidromic Repeats. A number of protein families appear only in association with these repeats and are designated Cas (CRISPR-Associated) proteins. This small Cas family is represented by CT1134 of Chlorobium tepidum. This family belongs to a set of several Cas protein families, one each for a number of different CRISPR/Cas subtypes, that share a region of N-terminal sequence similarity modeled by TIGR02593. This family represents the Dvulg subtype of CRISPR/Cas locus.
