CC  Members of this transpeptidase family are, in most cases, designated sortase B, product of the srtB gene. This protein shows only distant similarity to the sortase A family, for which there may be several members in a single bacterial genome. Typical SrtB substrate motifs include NAKTN, NPKSS, etc, and otherwise resemble the LPXTG sorting signals recognized by sortase A proteins.
