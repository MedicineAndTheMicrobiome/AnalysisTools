CC  This model represents the iron-sulfur subunit, typically called the beta subunit, of various proteins that also contain a molybdopterin subunit and a heme b subunit. The group includes two distinct but very closely related periplasmic proteins of anaerobic respiration, selenate reductase and chlorate reductase. Other members of this family include  dimethyl sulphide dehydrogenase and ethylbenzene dehydrogenase.
