CC  This protein family is closely related to two different families of protein-(glutamine-N5) methyltransferase. The first is PrmB, which modifies ribosomal protein L3 in some bacteria. The second is PrmC (HemK), which modifies peptide chain release factors 1 and 2 in most bacteria and also in eukaryotes. The glutamine side chain-binding motif NPPY shared by PrmB and PrmC is N[VAT]PY in this family. The protein substrate is unknown.
