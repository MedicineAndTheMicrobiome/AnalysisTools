CC  In Bacillus subtilis [1] the expression of this protein, located in an operon with the structural subunits of xanthine dehydrogenase, has been found to be essential for XDH activity.  Some members of this family appear to have a distant relationship to the MobA protein involved in molybdopterin biosynthesis, although this may be coincidental.
