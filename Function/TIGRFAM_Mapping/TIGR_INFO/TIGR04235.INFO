CC  This protein family occurs in the seadornavirus virus group, with designation VP4 in Banna virus, Kadipiro virus, and Liao ning virus. Although this family has been suggested to resemble methyltransferases, members show apparent N-terminal sequence similarity to the outer capsid protein VP5 of the orbivirus group, such as bluetongue virus, which also belong to the Reoviridae.
