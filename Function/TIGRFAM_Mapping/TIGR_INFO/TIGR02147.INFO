CC  This family consists of the 40 members of a paralogous protein family in the rumen anaerobe Fibrobacter succinogenes S85 and a smaller number in Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus HD100. Member proteins are about 270 residues long and appear to lack signal sequences and transmembrane helices. The only perfectly conserved residue is a glycine in an otherwise poorly conserved region, suggesting members are not enzymes. The family is not characterized.
