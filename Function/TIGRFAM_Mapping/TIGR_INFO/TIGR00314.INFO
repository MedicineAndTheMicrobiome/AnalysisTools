CC  Acetyl-CoA decarbonylase/synthase (ACDS) is a multienzyme complex. Carbon monoxide dehydrogenase is a synonym. The ACDS complex carries out an unusual reaction involving the reversible cleavage and synthesis of acetyl-CoA in methanogens. The model contains the prosite signature for 4Fe-4S ferredoxins [C-x(2)-C-x(2)-C-x(3)-C-[PEG]] between residues 448-462 of the model.
