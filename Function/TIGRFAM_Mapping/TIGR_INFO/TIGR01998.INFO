CC  This HMM represents the combined B and C domains of the PTS transport system enzyme II specific for N-acetylglucosamine transport [1].  Many of the genes in this family also include an A domain as part of the same polypeptide and thus should be given the name "PTS system, N-acetylglucosamine-specific IIABC component".  This family is most closely related to the glucose-specific PTS enzymes.
