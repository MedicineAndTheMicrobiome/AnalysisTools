CC  This small protein has a very limited distribution, being found so far only among some gamma-Proteobacteria. The member from Escherichia coli was shown to bind selenium in the absence of a working SelD-dependent selenium incorporation system. Note that while the E. coli member contains a single Cys residue, a likely selenium binding site, some other members of this protein family contain two Cys residues or none.
