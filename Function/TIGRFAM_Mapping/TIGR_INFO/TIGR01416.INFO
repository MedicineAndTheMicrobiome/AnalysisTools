CC  This model represents the Proteobacterial and mitochondrial type of the Rieske [2Fe-2S] iron-sulfur as found in ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase. The model excludes the Rieske iron-sulfur protein as found in the cytochrome b6-f complex of the Cyanobacteria and chloroplasts.
CC  Most members of this family have a recognizable twin-arginine translocation (tat) signal sequence (DeltaPh-dependent translocation in chloroplast) for transport across the membrane with the 2Fe-2S group already bound. These signal sequences include a motif resembling RRxFLK before the transmembrane helix.
