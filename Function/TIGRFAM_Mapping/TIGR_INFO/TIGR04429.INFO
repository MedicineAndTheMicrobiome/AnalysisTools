CC  Phr peptides are short peptides, best conserved in their amino-terminal regions, that are almost always encoded immediately downstream of a Rap phosphatase. A portion of the Phr peptide is secreted, enters another cell, and forms a quorum-sensing system by inhibiting its Rap phosphatase partner. The set of Phr peptides recognized by this N-terminal region model is disjoint from the PhrC/PhrF set recognized by Pfam model PF11131.
