CC  This small protein (MtrF) is one of eight subunits of the   N5-methyltetrahydromethanopterin:
CC  coenzyme M methyltransferase in methanogenic archaea. This methyltranferase is membrane-associated enzyme complex that uses methy-transfer reaction to drive sodium-ion pump. Archaea domain, have evolved energy-yielding pathways marked by one-carbon biochemistry featuring novel cofactors and enzymes. This transferase is involved in the transfer of 'methyl' group from N5-methyltetrahydromethanopterin to coenzyme M. In an accompanying reaction, methane is produced by two-electron reduction of the methyl moiety in methyl-coenzyme M by another enzyme methyl-coenzyme M reductase.
