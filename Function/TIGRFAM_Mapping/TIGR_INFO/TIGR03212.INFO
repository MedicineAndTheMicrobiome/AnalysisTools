EN  putative urate catabolism protein
TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  This model represents a protein that is predominantly found just upstream of the UraD protein (OHCU decarboxylase) and in a number of instances as a N-terminal fusion with it. UraD itself catalyzes the last step in the catabolism of urate to allantoate [1].  The function of this protein is presently unknown.  It shows homology with the PF01522 polysaccharide deacetylase domain family.
