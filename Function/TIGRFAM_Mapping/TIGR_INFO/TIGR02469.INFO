CC  This model recognizes the CbiT methylase which is responsible, in part (along with CbiE), for methylating precorrin-6y (or cobalt-precorrin-6y) at both the 5 and 15 positions as well as the concomitant decarbozylation at C-12.  In many organisms, this protein is fused to the CbiE subunit.  The fused protein, when found in organisms catalyzing the oxidative version of the cobalamin biosynthesis pathway, is called CobL.
