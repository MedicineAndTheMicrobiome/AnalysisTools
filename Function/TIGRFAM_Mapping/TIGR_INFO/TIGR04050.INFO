CC  Members of this family include the C-terminal region of MSMEG_0567 from Mycobacterium smegmatis, where the N-terminal is a GNAT family N-acetyltransferase, and resemble the full length of sll0787 from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. The conserved cluster that contains these is found broadly (Cyanobacteria, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria) in about 8 percent of genomes and appears to be biosynthetic. The product is unkown.
