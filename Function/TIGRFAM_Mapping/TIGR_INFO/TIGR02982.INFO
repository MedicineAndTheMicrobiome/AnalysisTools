CC  Members of this protein family are found mostly in the Cyanobacteria, but also in the Planctomycetes. Cyanobacterial examples are involved in heterocyst formation, by which some fraction of members of the colony undergo a developmental change and become capable of nitrogen fixation. The DevBCA proteins are thought export of either heterocyst-specific glycolipids or an enzyme essential for formation of the laminated layer found in heterocysts.
