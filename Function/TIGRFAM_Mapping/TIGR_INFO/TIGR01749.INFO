CC  This enzyme, FabA, shows overlapping substrate specificity with FabZ with regard to chain length in fatty acid biosynthesis. It is commonly designated 3-hydroxydecanoyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] dehydratase (EC 4.2.1.60) as if it were specific for that chain length, but its specificity is broader; it is active even in the initiation of fatty acid biosynthesis. This enzyme can also isomerize trans-2-decenoyl-ACP to cis-3-decenoyl-ACP to bypass reduction by FabI and instead allow biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids. FabA cannot elongate unsaturated fatty acids.
