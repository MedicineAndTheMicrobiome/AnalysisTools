CC  This model represents the well-conserved C-terminal region of the major, essential sigma factor of most bacteria. Members of this clade show considerable variability in domain architecture and molecular weight, as well as in nomenclature:  RpoD in E. coli and other Proteobacteria, SigA in Bacillus subtilis and many other Gram-positive bacteria, HrdB in Streptomyces, MysA in Mycobacterium smegmatis, etc.
