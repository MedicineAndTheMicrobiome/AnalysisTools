CC  Two closely related families of aspartate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase are found. They differ by a deep split in phylogenetic and percent identity trees and in gap patterns. This model represents a branch more closely related to the USG-1 protein than to the other aspartate-semialdehyde dehydrogenases represented in model TIGR00978.
