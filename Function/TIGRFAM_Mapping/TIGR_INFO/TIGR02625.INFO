CC  Members of this protein family are rhamnose mutarotase from Escherichia coli, previously designated YiiL as an uncharacterized protein, and close homologs also associated with rhamnose dissimilation operons in other bacterial genomes. Mutarotase is a term for an epimerase that changes optical activity. This enzyme was shown experimentally to interconvert alpha and beta stereoisomers of the pyranose form of L-rhamnose [1]. The crystal structure of this small (104 amino acid) protein shows a locally asymmetric dimer with active site residues of His, Tyr, and Trp [2].
