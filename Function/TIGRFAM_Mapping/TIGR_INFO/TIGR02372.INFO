CC  This model represents the 4-coumarate--CoA ligase associated with biosynthesis of the 4-hydroxy cinnamyl (also called 4-coumaroyl) chromophore covalently linked to a Cys residue in photoactive yellow protein of Rhodobacter spp. and  	
CC  Ectothiorhodospira halophila. This enzyme is designated 6.2.1.12 and therefore joins a number of plant enzymes linked to lignin biosynthesis and given similar names.
