CC  This family of uncharacterized proteins shows a low level of similarity (possibly meaningful) to the predicted membrane protein  YLR220W, which is involved in calcium homeostatis. It shows no similarity to any other characterized protein.
CC  This family is represented in three of the first four completed archaeal genomes, with two members in A. fulgidus.
