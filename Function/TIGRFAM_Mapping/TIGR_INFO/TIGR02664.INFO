CC  Most members of this protein family are found in the Cyanobacteria, and these mostly near nitrate reductase genes and molybdopterin biosynthesis genes. We note that molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide is a cofactor for nitrate reductase. This protein is sometimes annotated as nitrate reductase-associated protein. Its function is unknown.
