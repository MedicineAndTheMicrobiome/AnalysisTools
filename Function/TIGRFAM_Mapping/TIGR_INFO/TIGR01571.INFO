CC  This HMM describes an uncharacterized domain of about 100 residues. It is common in plants but found also in Homo sapiens, Dictyostelium, and Leishmania; at least 12 distinct members are found in Arabidopsis. Most members of this family contain more than 10 per cent Cys, but no Cys residue is invariant across the family.
