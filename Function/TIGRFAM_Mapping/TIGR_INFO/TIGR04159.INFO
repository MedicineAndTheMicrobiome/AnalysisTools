CC  The first characterized methanobactin is made from a ribosomal precursor in Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b. Two additional species with homologous precursor peptides (family TIGR04071) are Azospirillum sp. B510 and Gluconacetobacter sp. SXCC-1. This model describes a clique of related sequences, domain or full-length, that occurs always and only next to a methanobactin precursor. The model excludes some close homologs from species where no similar precursor can be found.

RT  A comparison of methanobactins from Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b and Methylocystis strain Sb2 predicts methanobactins are synthesized from diverse peptide precursors modified to create a common core for binding and reducing copper ions.
