CC  The sequences represented by this model are members of the PF04794 "YdjC-like" family of uncharacterized proteins.  The member of this clade from Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans ATCC 23270 (AFE_0976) is found in the same locus as squalene-hopene cyclase (SHC, TIGR01507) and other genes associated with the biosynthesis of hopanoid natural products.  Similarly, in Ralstonia eutropha JMP134 (Reut_B4902) this gene is adjacent to HpnAB, IspH and HpnH (TIGR03470), although SHC itself is elsewhere in the genome.  Notably, this gene (here named HpnK) and three others form a conserved set (HpnIJKL) which occur in a subset of all genomes containing the SHC enzyme.  This relationship was discerned using the method of partial phylogenetic profiling [1].  This group includes Zymomonas mobilis, the organism where the initial hopanoid biosynthesis locus was described consisting of the genes HpnA-E and SHC (HpnF) [2].  Continuing past SHC are found a phosphorylase enzyme (ZMO0873, i.e. HpnG, TIGR03468) and a radical SAM enzyme (ZMO0874), HpnH.  Although discontinuous in Z. mobilis, we continue the gene symbol sequence with HpnIJKL.
