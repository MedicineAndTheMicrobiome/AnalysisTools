CC  This group of sigma factors are members of the sigma-70 family (TIGR02937).  They and appear by homology, tree building and bidirectional best hits, to represent a conserved family.  This family is found in a limited number of bacterial lineages.  This family includes apparent paralogous expansion in Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2), and multiple copies in Mycobacterium smegmatis MC2, Streptomyces avermitilis MA-4680 and Nocardia farcinica IFM10152.
