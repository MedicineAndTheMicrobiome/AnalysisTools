CC  This model represents a single chain form of pyruvate:ferredoxin (or flavodoxin) oxidoreductase. This enzyme may transfer electrons to nitrogenase in nitrogen-fixing species. Portions of this protein are homologous to gamma subunit of the four subunit pyruvate:ferredoxin (flavodoxin) oxidoreductase.
