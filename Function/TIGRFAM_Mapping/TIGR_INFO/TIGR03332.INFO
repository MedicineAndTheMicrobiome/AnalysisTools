CC  Members of this family are the methionine salvage pathway enzyme 2,3-diketo-5-methylthiopentyl-1-phosphate enolase, a homolog of RuBisCO. This protein family seems restricted to Bacillus subtilis and close relatives, where two separate proteins carry the enolase and phosphatase activities that in other species occur in a single protein, MtnC (TIGR01691).
