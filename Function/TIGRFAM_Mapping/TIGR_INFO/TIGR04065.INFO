CC  Members of this protein family are Cys-rich putative bacteriocin precursor peptides restricted to the Clostridia but found in multiple species with up to three per genome. They are found next to a CLI_3234 family radical SAM protein that may perform post-translational modification. This model describes approximately 35 residues starting from the N-terminus. Precursor peptides average about 50 amino acids in length.
