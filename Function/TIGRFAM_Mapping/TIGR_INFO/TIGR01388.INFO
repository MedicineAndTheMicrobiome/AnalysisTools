CC  This model describes ribonuclease D, a 3'-exonuclease shown to act on tRNA both in vitro and when overexpressed in vivo. Trusted members of this family are restricted to the Proteobacteria; Aquifex, Mycobacterial, and eukaryotic homologs are not full-length homologs. Ribonuclease D is not essential in E. coli and is deleterious when overexpressed. Its precise biological role is still unknown.
