CC  This model represents two closely related clades of sequences from eukaryotes and archaea.  The mouse enzyme has been characterized as a phosphatase and has been positively identified as a member of the haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily by site-directed mutagenesis of the active site residues [1,2].
