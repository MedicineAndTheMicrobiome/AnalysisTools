CC  This family consists of the NifV clade of homocitrate synthases, most of which are found in operons for nitrogen fixation. Members are closely homologous to enzymes that include  2-isopropylmalate synthase, (R)-citramalate synthase, and  homocitrate synthases associated with other processes. The homocitrate made by this enzyme becomes a part of the iron-molybdenum cofactor of nitrogenase.
