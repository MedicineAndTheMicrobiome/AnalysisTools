CC  Members of this family are bacteriocin precursors. These small, ribosomally produced polypeptide precursors are extensively processed post-translationally. This family belongs to a class of heterocycle-containing bacteriocins, including streptolysin S from Streptococcus pyogenes, and related bacteriocins from Streptococcus iniae and Clostridium botulinum. Streptolysin S is hemolytic. Bacteriocin genes in general are small and highly diverse, with odd sequence composition, and are easily missed by many gene-finding programs.
