CC  This HMM describes a short protein (80-93 residues) homologous to the C-terminus of the flagellar biosynthetic protein FlhB. It is found so far only in species that also have FlhB. In a phylogenetic tree based on alignment of both this family and the homologous region of FlhB and its homologs, the members of this family form a monophyletic set.
