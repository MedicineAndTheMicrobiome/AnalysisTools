CC  This family of proteins is found within type III secretion operons.  The protein has been characterized [1] as a chaperone for the outer membrane pore component YscC (TIGR02516).  YscW is a lipoprotein which is itself localized to the outer membrane and, it is believed, facilitates the oligomerization and localization of YscC.
