CC  Members of this family are examples of pyruvate oxidase (EC 1.2.3.3), an enzyme with FAD and TPP as cofactors that catalyzes the reaction pyruvate + phosphate + O2 + H2O = acetyl phosphate + CO2 + H2O2. It should not be confused with pyruvate dehydrogenase [cytochrome] (EC 1.2.2.2) as in E. coli PoxB, although the E. coli enzyme is closely homologous and has pyruvate oxidase as an alternate name.
