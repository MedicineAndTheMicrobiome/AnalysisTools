CC  This HMM describes a set of proteins related to but longer than DNA-binding protein HU. Its distinctive domain architecture compared to HU and related histone-like DNA-binding proteins justifies the designation as superfamily. Members include, so far, one from Bacteroides fragilis, a gut bacterium, and ten from Porphyromonas gingivalis, an oral anaerobe.
