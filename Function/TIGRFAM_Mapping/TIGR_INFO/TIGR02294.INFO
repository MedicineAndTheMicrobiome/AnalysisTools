CC  Members of this family are periplasmic nickel-binding proteins of nickel ABC transporters.  Most appear to be lipoproteins. This protein was previously (circa 2003) thought to mediate binding to nickel through water molecules, but is now thought to involve a chelating organic molecule, perhaps butane-1,2,4-tricarboxylate, acting as a metallophore.
