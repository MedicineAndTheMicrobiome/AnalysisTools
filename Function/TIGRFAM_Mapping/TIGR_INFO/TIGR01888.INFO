CC  CRISPR is a term for Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palidromic Repeats. A number of protein families appear only in association with these repeats and are designated Cas (CRISPR associated) proteins. This highly divergent family is  found in at least ten different archaeal and bacterial species as part of the CRISPR RAMP modulue but is not a member of the RAMP superfamily itself. A typical example is  TM1793 from Thermotoga maritima.
