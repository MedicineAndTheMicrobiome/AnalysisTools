CC  This HMM describes A, or gamma, subunit of the bcr type of benzoyl-CoA reductase, a 4-subunit enzyme. Many aromatic compounds are metabolized by way of benzoyl-CoA. This family shows strong sequence similarity to the 2-hydroxyglutaryl-CoA dehydratase alpha chain and to subunits of different types of benzoyl-CoA reductase (such as the bzd type).
