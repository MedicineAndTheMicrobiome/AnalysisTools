CC  This archaeal protein catalyzes the same reaction, the final step in riboflavin biosynthesis, as bacterial riboflavin biosynthesis alpha chain. However, it is more similar in sequence to 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine synthase, which catalyzes the previous reaction and which (in bacteria) is called the riboflavin synthase beta chain.
