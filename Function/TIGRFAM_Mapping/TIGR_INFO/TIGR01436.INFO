CC  This HMM represents one of two highly dissimilar forms of glutamate--cysteine ligase (gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase), an enzyme of glutathione biosynthesis. The other type is modeled by TIGR01434. This type is found in plants (with a probable transit peptide), root nodule and other bacteria, but not E. coli and closely related species.
