CC  This subfamily includes the well-studied secreted O-sialoglycoprotein endopeptidase (glycoprotease, EC 3.4.24.57) of Pasteurella haemolytica, a pathogen. A member from Riemerella anatipestifer, associated with cohemolysin activity, likewise is exported without benefit of a classical signal peptide and shows glycoprotease activity on the test substrate glycophorin. However, archaeal members of this subfamily show unrelated activities as demonstrated in Pyrococcus abyssi: DNA binding, iron binding, apurinic endonuclease activity, genomic association with a kinase domain, and no glycoprotease activity. This family thus pulls together a set of proteins as a homology group that appears to be near-universal in life, yet heterogeneous in assayed function between bacteria and archaea.
