CC  This HMM describes a family of phage (and bacteriocin) proteins related to the phage P2 V gene product, which forms the small spike at the tip of the tail. Homologs in general are annotated as baseplate assembly protein V. At least one member is encoded within a region of Pectobacterium carotovorum (Erwinia carotovora) described as a bacteriocin, a phage tail-derived module able to kill bacteria closely related to the host strain.
DR  EXPERIMENTAL; SP:P31340; phage P2; small spike at tip of tail
