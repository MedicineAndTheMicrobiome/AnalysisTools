CC  All members of this cyanobacterial protein family are the transcriptional regulator SufR and regulate the SUF system, which makes possible iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis despite exposure to oxygen. In all cases, the sufR gene is encoded near SUF system genes but in the opposite direction. This DNA-binding protein belongs to the the DeoR family of helix-loop-helix proteins. All members also have a probable metal-binding motif C-X(12)-C-X(13)-C-X(14)-C near the C-terminus.

RT  The sufR gene (sll0088 in Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803) functions as a repressor of the sufBCDS operon in iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis in cyanobacteria.
