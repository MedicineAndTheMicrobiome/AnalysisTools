CC  Members of this family are short precursor peptides in which the mature form undergoes a cyclization between a Lys and a Trp four residues away. The modification enzyme appears to be an adjacent encoded radical SAM protein. Genomes encoding this system include Streptococcus thermophilus LMD-9 and Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris MG1363, among others.
