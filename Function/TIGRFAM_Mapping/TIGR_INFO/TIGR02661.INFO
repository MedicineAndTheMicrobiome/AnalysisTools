CC  This protein, MauD, appears critical to proper formation of the small subunit of methylamine dehydrogenase, which has both an unusual tryptophan tryptophylquinone cofactor and multiple disulfide bonds. MauD shares sequence similarity, including a CPxC motif, with a number of thiol:disulfide interchange proteins. In MauD mutants, the small subunit apparently does not form properly and is rapidly degraded.
