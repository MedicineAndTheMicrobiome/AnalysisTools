CC  Of four genes commonly found to be involved in biosynthesis and export of poly-gamma-glutamate, pgsB(capB) and pgsC(capC) are found to be involved in the synthesis per se. Members of this family are designated PgsC, covering both cases in which the poly-gamma-glutamate is secreted and those in which it is retained to form capsular material. PgsC binds tightly to PgsB, which has been shown to have poly-gamma-glutamate activity.
