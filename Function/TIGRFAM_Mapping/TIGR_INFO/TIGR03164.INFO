CC  Previously thought to only proceed spontaneously, the decarboxylation of 2-oxo-4-hydroxy-4-carboxy--5-ureidoimidazoline (OHCU) has been recently been shown to be catalyzed by this enzyme in Mus musculus [1].  Homologs of this enzyme are found adjacent to and fused with uricase in a number of prokaryotes and are represented by this model.
