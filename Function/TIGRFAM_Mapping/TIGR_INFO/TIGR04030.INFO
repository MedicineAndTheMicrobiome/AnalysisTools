CC  Members of this family represent a narrow clade that falls within a family of alkylhydroperoxidase-related proteins, fused to or adjacent to a sequence described by TIGR04029. These two partners occur almost always in the context of a putative FMN-dependent luciferase-like monooxygenase (LLM) (TIGR04027), and an ABC transporter in which TIGR04028 models the substrate-binding protein.
