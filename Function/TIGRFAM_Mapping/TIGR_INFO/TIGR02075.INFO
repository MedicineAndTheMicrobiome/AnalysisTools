CC  This protein, also called UMP kinase, converts UMP to UDP by adding a phosphate from ATP. It is the first step in pyrimidine biosynthesis. GTP is an allosteric activator. In a large fraction of all bacterial genomes, the gene tends to be located immediately downstream of elongation factor Ts and upstream of ribosome recycling factor. A related protein family, believed to be equivalent in function and found in the archaea and in spirochetes, is described by a separate model, TIGR02076.
