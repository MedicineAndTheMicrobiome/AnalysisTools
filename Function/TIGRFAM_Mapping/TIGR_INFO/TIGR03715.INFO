CC  This model describes a novel form of signal peptide that occurs as an N-terminal domain with a recognizable motif, reminiscent of the YSIRK and PEP-CTERM forms of signal peptide. This domain tends to occur on long, low-complexity (usually Serine-rich and heavily glycosylated) proteins of the Firmicutes, and (as with YSIRK) the majority of these proteins have the LPXTG cell wall-anchoring motif at the C-terminus.
