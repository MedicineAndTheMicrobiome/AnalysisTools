CC  Members of this protein family are the membrane-anchoring, non-catalytic C subunit, product of the glpC gene, of a three-subunit, FAD-dependent, anaerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. GlpC lasks classical hydrophobic transmembrane helices; Cole, et al suggest interaction with the membrane may involve amphipathic helices. GlcC has conserved Cys-containing motifs suggestive of iron-sulfur binding. This complex is found mostly in Escherichia coli and closely related species.
