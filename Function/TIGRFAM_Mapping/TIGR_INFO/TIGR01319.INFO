CC  This small family includes, so far, an uncharacterized protein from E. coli O157:H7 and GlmL from Clostridium tetanomorphum and Clostridium cochlearium. GlmL is located between the genes for the two subunits, epsilon (GlmE) and sigma (GlmS), of the coenzyme-B12-dependent glutamate mutase (methylaspartate mutase), the first enzyme in a pathway of glutamate fermentation. Members shows significant sequence similarity to the hydantoinase branch of the hydantoinase/oxoprolinase family (PF01968).
