CC  Members of this protein family are related to a known protein-tyrosine autokinase and to numerous homologs from exopolysaccharide biosynthesis region proteins, many of which are designated as chain length determinants. Most members of this family contain a short region, immediately C-terminal to the region modeled here, with an abundance of Tyr residues. These C-terminal tyrosine residues are likely to be autophosphorylation sites. Some members of this family are fusion proteins.
