CC  Members of this protein family are homologous to SecA and part of the accessory Sec system. This system, including both five core proteins for export and a variable number of proteins for glycosylation, operates in certain Gram-positive pathogens for the maturation and delivery of serine-rich glycoproteins such as the cell surface glycoprotein GspB in Streptococcus gordonii.
