CC  This HMM represents a subfamily of the FGGY family of carbohydrate kinases. This subfamily is closely related to  a set of ribulose kinases, and many members are designated ribitol kinase. However, the member from Klebsiella pneumoniae, from a ribitol catabolism operon, accepts D-ribulose and to a lesser extent D-arabinitol and ribitol (PMID:9639934 and JW Lengeler, personal communication); its annotation in GenBank as ribitol kinase is imprecise and may have affected public annotation of related proteins.
