CC  This protein is involved in the purine and pyrimidine salvage pathway. It catalyzes the conversion of D-ribose 1-phosphate to D-ribose 5-phosphate and the conversion of 2-deoxy-D-ribose 1-phosphate to 2-deoxy-D-ribose 5-phosphate. The seed members of this protein are characterized deoB proteins from E.Coli(SP:P07651) and Bacillus (SP:P46353). This HMM matches PF01676 for Metalloenzyme superfamily.
