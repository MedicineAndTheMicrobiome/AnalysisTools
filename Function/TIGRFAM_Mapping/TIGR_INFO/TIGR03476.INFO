CC  This family of hydrophobic proteins is observed in two distinct contexts.  It is primarily found in the presence of genes for the biosynthesis and elaboration of hopene where we assign the gene symbol HpnL.  In a subset of the genomes containing HpnL a second, often plasmid-encoded, homolog is observed in a context implying the biosynthesis of 2-aminoethylphosphonate head-group containing lipids.
