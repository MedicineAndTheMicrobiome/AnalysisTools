CC  This model describes a family similar to RecD, the exodeoxyribonuclease V alpha chain of TIGR01447. Members of this family, however, are not found in a context of RecB and RecC and are longer by about 200 amino acids at the amino end. Chlamydia muridarum has both a member of this family and a RecD.
