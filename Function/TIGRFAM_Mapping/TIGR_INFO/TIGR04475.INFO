CC  Members of this family have the  MIO prosthetic group (4-methylideneimidazole-5-one), derived from an Ala-Ser-Gly motif. Other MIO enzymes include Phe, Tyr, and His ammonia-lyases. The member from Pantoea agglomerans, and probably all members, convert Phe to D-beta-phenylalanine (EC 5.4.3.11). By contrast, members of family TIGR04473 convert Phe to L-beta-phenylalanine (5.4.3.10), as in taxol biosynthesis.
