CC  Homologous proteins related to MJ0570 of Methanococcus jannaschii include both the apparent orthologs found by this model above the trusted cutoff, the much longer protein YLR143W from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and second homologous proteins from Archaeoglobus fulgidus and Pyrococcus horikoshii that appear to represent a second orthologous group.
