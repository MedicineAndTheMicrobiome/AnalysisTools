CC  This HMM describes a domain found in some proteins associated with polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) granules in a subset of species that have PHA inclusion granules. Included are two tandem proteins of Pseudomonas oleovorans, PhaI and PhaF, and their homologs in related species. PhaF proteins have a low-complexity C-terminal region with repeats similar to AAAKP.
