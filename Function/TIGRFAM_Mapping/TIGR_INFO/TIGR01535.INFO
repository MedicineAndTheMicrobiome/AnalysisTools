CC  Glucan 1,4-alpha-glucosidase catalyzes the hydrolysis of terminal 1,4-linked alpha-D-glucose residues from non-reducing ends of polysaccharides, releasing a beta-D-glucose monomer.  Some forms of this enzyme can hydrolyze terminal 1,6- and 1,3-alpha-D-glucosidic bonds in polysaccharides as well.
