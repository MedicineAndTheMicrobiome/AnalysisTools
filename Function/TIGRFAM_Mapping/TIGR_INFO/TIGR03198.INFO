CC  This gene has been characterized in B. subtilis [1] as the Iron-sulfur cluster binding-subunit of xanthine dehydrogenase (pucE), acting in conjunction with pucC, the FAD-binding subunit and pucD, the molybdopterin binding subunit.  The more common XDH complex (GenProp0640) includes the xdhA gene as the Fe-S cluster binding component.
