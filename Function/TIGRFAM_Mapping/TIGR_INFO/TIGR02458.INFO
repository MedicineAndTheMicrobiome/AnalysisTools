CC  This model represents a family of proteins which have been proposed [1] to act as cobalt transporters acting in concert with vitamin B12 biosynthesis systems.  Evidence for this assignment includes 1) prediction of five trans-membrane segments, 2) positional gene linkage with known B12 biosynthesis genes, 3) upstream proximity of B12 transcriptional regulatory sites, 4) the absence of other known cobalt import systems and 5) the obligate co-localization with a small protein (CbtB) having a single additional trans-membrane segment and a C-terminal histidine-rich motif likely to be a metal-binding site.
