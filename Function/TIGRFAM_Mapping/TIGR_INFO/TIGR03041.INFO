CC  This model represents a family of proteins from the Cyanobacteria, closely homologous to and yet distinct from PbsC, a chlorophyll a antenna protein of photosystem II. Members are not univerally present in Cyanobacteria, while the family has several members per genome in Prochlorococcus marinus, with seven members in a strain adapted to low light conditions. These antenna proteins may deliver light energy to photosystem I and/or photosystem II.
