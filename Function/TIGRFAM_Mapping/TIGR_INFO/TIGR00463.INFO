CC  The glutamyl-tRNA synthetases of the eukaryotic cytosol and of the Archaea are more similar to glutaminyl-tRNA synthetases than to bacterial glutamyl-tRNA synthetases. This HMM models just the eukaryotic cytosolic and archaeal forms of the enzyme. In some eukaryotes, the glutamyl-tRNA synthetase is part of a longer, multifunctional aminoacyl-tRNA ligase. In many species, the charging of tRNA(gln) proceeds first through misacylation with Glu and then transamidation. For this reason, glutamyl-tRNA synthetases, including all known archaeal enzymes (as of 2010) may act on both tRNA(gln) and tRNA(glu).
