CC  This model describes a nearly twenty member protein family in Verrucomicrobium spinosum and a somewhat smaller paralogous family in Chthoniobacter flavus. All members share a type IV pilin-like N-terminal leader sequence (TIGR02532). These proteins occur in the four-gene Verru_Chthon cassette, in which two other genes likewise encode a cleavage/methylation domain. Most of these cassettes occur next to an unusually large PEP-CTERM protein with an autotransporter domain.
