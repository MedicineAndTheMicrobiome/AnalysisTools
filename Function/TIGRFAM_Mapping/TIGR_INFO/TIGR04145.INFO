CC  This C-terminal domain is found only in the Firmicutes, where its presence is sporadically distributed. Proteins with this domain are most conserved in the C-terminal region, where the pattern of ending with a transmembrane domain resembles both the LPXTG (sortase target) and PEP-CTERM (exosortase target) domain structures. However, members occur exclusively in the presence of an exosortase-like protein XrtG (TIGR03110), a putative glycosyltransferase (TIGR03111), and a 6-pyruvoyl tetrahydropterin synthase-related protein (TIGR03112).
