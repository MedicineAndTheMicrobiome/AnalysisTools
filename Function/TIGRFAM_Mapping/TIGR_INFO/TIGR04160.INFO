CC  The first characterized methanobactin is made from a ribosomal precursor in Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b. Two additional species with homologous precursor peptides (family TIGR04071) are Azospirillum sp. B510 and Gluconacetobacter sp. SXCC-1. This model describes a clique of related sequences, domain or full-length, that occurs always and only next to a methanobactin precursor of the Mb-OB3b type. The model excludes several Pseudomonas proteins whose function is unknown, which likewise are in model TIGR04061, but which diverge toward the C-terminus.
