TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  Members of this family include YscP of the Yersinia type III secretion system and equivalent proteins in other animal pathogen bacterial type III secretion systems. The model describes the conserved C-terminal region. N-terminal regions are poorly conserved and variable in length with some low-complexity sequence.
