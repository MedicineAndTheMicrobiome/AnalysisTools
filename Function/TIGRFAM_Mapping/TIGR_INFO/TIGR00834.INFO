CC  The Anion Exchanger (AE) Family (TC 2.A.31)
CC  Characterized protein members of the AE family are found only in animals.
CC  They preferentially catalyze anion exchange (antiport) reactions, typically acting as HCO3-:Cl- antiporters, but also transporting a range of other inorganic and organic anions. Additionally, renal Na+:HCO3- cotransporters have been found to be members of the AE family. They catalyze the reabsorption of HCO3- in the renal proximal tubule.
