CC  This model represents a small clade of ribonucleoside-diphosphate reductase, alpha chains which are sufficiently divergent from the usual Class I RNR alpha chains (NrdE or NrdA, TIGR02506) as to warrant their own model.  The genes from Thermus thermophilus, Dichelobacter and Salinibacter are adjacent to the usual RNR beta chain.
