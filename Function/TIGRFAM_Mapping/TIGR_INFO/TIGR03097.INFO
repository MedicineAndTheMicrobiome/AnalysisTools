CC  These proteins are members of the O-antigen polymerase (wzy) family described by Pfam model PF04932.  This group is  associated with genomes and ususally genomic contexts containing elements of the exosortase/PEP-CTERM protein export system [1], specificially the type 1 variety of this system described by the Genome Property, GenProp0652.
