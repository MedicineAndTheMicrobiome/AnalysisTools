CC  This HMM describes the glutamine amidotransferase domain or peptide of the tryptophan-biosynthetic pathway enzyme anthranilate synthase or of the folate biosynthetic pathway enzyme para-aminobenzoate synthase. In at least one case, a single polypeptide from Bacillus subtilis was shown to have both functions. This model covers a subset of the sequences described by the PFAM HMM GATase.
