CC  This HMM represents as ATP:cob(I)alamin adenosyltransferase  family corresponding to the N-terminal half of Salmonella PduO, a 1,2-propanediol utilization protein that probably is bifunctional. PduO represents one of at least three families of ATP:corrinoid adenosyltransferase: others are CobA (which partially complements PduO) and EutT. It was not clear originally whether ATP:cob(I)alamin adenosyltransferase activity resides in the N-terminal region of PduO, modeled here, but this has now become clear from the characterization of MeaD from Methylobacterium extorquens.
