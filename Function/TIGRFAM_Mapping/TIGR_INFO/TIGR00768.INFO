CC  This family, related to bacterial glutathione synthetases, contains at least three different alpha-L-glutamate ligases. One is RimK, as in E. coli, which adds additional Glu residues to the native Glu-Glu C-terminus of ribosomal protein S6, but not to Lys-Glu mutants. Most species with a member of this subfamily lack an S6 homolog ending in Glu-Glu, however. Members in Methanococcus jannaschii act instead as a tetrahydromethanopterin:alpha-l-glutamate ligase (MJ0620) and a gamma-F420-2:alpha-l-glutamate ligase (MJ1001).
