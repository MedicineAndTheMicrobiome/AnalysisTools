CC  Members of this protein family are probable glycosyltransferases of family 2, whose genes are near those for the exosortase homolog XrtG (TIGR03110), which is restricted to Gram-positive bacteria. Other genes in the conserved gene neighborhood include a 6-pyruvoyl tetrahydropterin synthase homolog (TIGR03112) and an uncharacterized intergral membrane protein (TIGR03766).
