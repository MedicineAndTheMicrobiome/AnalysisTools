CC  Mycothiol, a glutathione analog in Mycobacterium tuberculosis and related species, can form a disulfide-linked dimer called mycothione. This enzyme can reduce mycothione to regenerate two mycothiol molecules. The enzyme shows some sequence similarity to glutathione-disulfide reductase, trypanothione-disulfide reductase, and dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase. The characterized protein from M. tuberculosis, a homodimer, has FAD as a cofactor, one per monomer, and uses NADPH as a substrate.
