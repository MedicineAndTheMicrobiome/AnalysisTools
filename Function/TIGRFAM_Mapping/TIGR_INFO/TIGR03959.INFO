CC  Members of this protein family occur as part of a system for producing iron-only hydrogenases, dependent on radical SAM proteins HydE and HydG and GTPase HydF. One member of this family, TM_1266 from Thermotoga maritima, has a known crystal structure. The small size, about 80 residues, and a distant relationship to the nickel regulator NikR of the CopG transcriptional regulator family suggest a role as a transcription factor.
