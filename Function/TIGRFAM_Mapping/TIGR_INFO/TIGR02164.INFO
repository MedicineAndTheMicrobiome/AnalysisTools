CC  This very narrowly defined family represents TorA, part of a family of related molybdoenzymes that include biotin sulfoxide reductases, dimethyl sulfoxide reductases, and at least two different subfamilies of trimethylamine-N-oxide reductases. A single enzyme from the larger family may have more than one activity. TorA typically is located in the periplasm, has a Tat (twin-arginine translocation)-dependent signal sequence, and is encoded in a torCAD operon.
