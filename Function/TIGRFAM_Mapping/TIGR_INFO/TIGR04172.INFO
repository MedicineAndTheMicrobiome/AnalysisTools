CC  The DND system produces an phosphorothioation modification to DNA, replacing a non-bridging oxygen of a phosphate group with sulfur. The modification causes DNA degradation during electrophoresis in Tris buffer. This protein, like DndB (TIGR03233), contains a DGQHR domain (TIGR03187), which also occurs in several contexts that suggest lateral transfer rather than DNA phosphorothioation-dependent restriction.
