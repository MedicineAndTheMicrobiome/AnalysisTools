CC  Members of this model form a distinct subset of the larger family of oxidoreductases that includes zinc-binding alcohol dehydrogenases and NADPH:quinone reductases (PF00107). While some current members of this family carry designations as putative alginate lyase, it seems no sequence with a direct characterization as such is detected by this model.
