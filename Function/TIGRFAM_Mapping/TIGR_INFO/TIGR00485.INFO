CC  This HMM models orthologs of translation elongation factor EF-Tu in bacteria, mitochondria, and chloroplasts, one of several GTP-binding translation factors found by the more general pfam HMM GTP_EFTU. The eukaryotic conterpart, eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 (eEF-1 alpha), is excluded from this model. EF-Tu is one of the most abundant proteins in bacteria, as well as one of the most highly conserved, and in a number of species the gene is duplicated with identical function. When bound to GTP, EF-Tu can form a complex with any (correctly) aminoacylated tRNA except those for initiation and for selenocysteine, in which case EF-Tu is replaced by other factors. Transfer RNA is carried to the ribosome in these complexes for protein translation.
