CC  This HMM describes a broadly distributed family of transporters, a number of which have been shown to transport divalent cations of cobalt, cadmium and/or zinc. The family has six predicted transmembrane domains. Members of the family are variable in length because of variably sized inserts, often containing low-complexity sequence.
