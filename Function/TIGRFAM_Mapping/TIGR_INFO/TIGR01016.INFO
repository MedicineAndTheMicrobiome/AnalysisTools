CC  This model is designated subfamily because it does not discriminate the ADP-forming enzyme ((EC 6.2.1.5) from the GDP_forming (EC 6.2.1.4) enzyme.
CC  The N-terminal half is described by the CoA-ligases HMM (PF00549). The C-terminal half is described by the ATP-grasp HMM (PF02222).
CC  This family contains a split seen both in a maximum parsimony tree (which ignores gaps) and in the gap pattern near position 85 of the seed alignment. Eukaryotic and most bacterial sequences are longer and contain a region similar to TXQTXXXG. Sequences from Deinococcus radiodurans, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Streptomyces coelicolor, and the Archaea are 6 amino acids shorter in that region and contain a motif resembling [KR]G
