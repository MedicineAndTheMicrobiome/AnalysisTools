CC  This HMM describes a protein related to a number of pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enzymes, and in particular to selenocysteine synthase (SelA), which converts Ser to selenocysteine on its tRNA. While resembling SelA, this protein is found only in species that have a better candidate SelA or else lack the other genes (selB, selC, and selD) required for selenocysteine incorporation.
