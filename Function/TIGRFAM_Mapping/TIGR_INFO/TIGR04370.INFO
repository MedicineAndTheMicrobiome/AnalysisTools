CC  Members of this subfamily of highly hydrophobic proteins, with few highly conserved residues, all may act to polymerize the oligosaccharide repeat units of surface polysaccharides, including O-antigen in Gram-negative bacteria such as Leptospira (assign gene symbol wzy) and capsular polysaccharide in Gram-positive bacteria such as Streptococcus.
CC  O-antigen biosynthesis enzymes produce a repeat unit, usually an oligosaccharide, which itself is polymerized.  O-antigen polymerase, usually designated Wzy. This family bears homology to the O-antigen ligase WaaL, but known examples of WaaL fall outside the bounds defined here. This model is much broader than Pfam model PF14296.
