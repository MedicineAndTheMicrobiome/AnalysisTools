CC  This family includes lycopene beta and epsilion cyclases (which form beta and delta carotene, respectively) from bacteria and plants as well as the plant capsanthin/capsorubin and neoxanthin cyclases which appear to have evolved from the plant lycopene cyclases.  The plant lycopene epsilon cyclases also transform neurosporene to alpha zeacarotene.
