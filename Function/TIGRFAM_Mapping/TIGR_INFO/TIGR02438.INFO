CC  Members of this family are catechol 1,2-dioxygenases of the Actinobacteria. They are more closely related to actinobacterial chlorocatechol 1,2-dioxygenases than to proteobacterial catechol 1,2-dioxygenases, and so are built in this separate model. The member from Rhodococcus rhodochrous NCIMB 13259 (GB|AAC33003.1) is described as a homodimer with bound Fe, similarly active on catechol, 3-methylcatechol and 4-methylcatechol.
