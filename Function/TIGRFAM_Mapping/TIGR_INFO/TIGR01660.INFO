CC  The Nitrate reductase enzyme complex allows bacteria to use nitrate as an electron acceptor during anaerobic growth. The enzyme complex consists of a tetramer that has an alpha, beta and 2 gamma subunits. The alpha and beta subunits have catalytic activity and the gamma subunits attach the enzyme to the membrane and is a b-type cytochrome that receives electrons from the quinone pool and transfers them to the beta subunit. This model is specific for the beta subunit for nitrate reductase I (narH) and nitrate reductase II (narY) for gram positive and gram negative bacteria.A few thermophiles and archaea also match the model.The seed members used in this model are all experimentally characterized and include the following:SP:P11349, and SP:P19318, both E.Coli (NarH and NarY respectively), SP:P42176 from B. Subtilis, GP:11344602 from Psuedomonas fluorescens,GP:541762 from Paracoccus denitrificans, and GP:18413622 from Halomonas halodenitrificans. This HMM also matches PFAM PF00037 for 4Fe-4S binding domain.
