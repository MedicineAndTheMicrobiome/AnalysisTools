CC  Two closely related families of aspartate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase are found. They differ by a deep split in phylogenetic and percent identity trees and in gap patterns. Separate models are built for the two types in order to exclude the USG-1 protein, found in several species, which is specifically related to the Bacillus subtilis type of aspartate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase. Members of this type are found primarily in organisms that lack peptidoglycan.
