CC  Members of this protein family closely resemble the CcmF protein of the CcmABCDEFGH system, or system I, for c-type cytochrome biogenesis (GenProp0678). Members are found, as a rule, next to closely related paralogs of CcmG and CcmH and always located near other genes associated with the cytochrome c nitrite reductase enzyme complex. As a rule, members are found in species that also encode bona fide members of the CcmF, CcmG, and CcmH families.
