CC  PylS is the enzyme responsible for charging the pyrrolysine tRNA, PylT, by ligating a free molecule of pyrrolysine. Pyrrolysine is encoded at an in-frame UAG (amber) at least in several corrinoid-dependent methyltransferases of the archaeal genera Methanosarcina and Methanococcoides, such as trimethylamine methyltransferase. This protein occurs as a fusion protein in Methanosarcina but as split genes in Desulfitobacterium hafniense and other bacteria. This model describes the small, N-terminal region.
