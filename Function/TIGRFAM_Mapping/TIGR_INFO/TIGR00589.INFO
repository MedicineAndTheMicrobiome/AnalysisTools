CC  All proteins in this family for which functions are known are involved alkyl-DNA transferases which remove alkyl groups from DNA as part of alkylation DNA repair.  Some of the proteins in this family are also transcription regulators and have a distinct transcription regulatory domain. This family is based on the phylogenomic analysis of JA Eisen (1999, Ph.D. Thesis, Stanford University).
