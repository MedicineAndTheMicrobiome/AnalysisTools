CC  The E. coli member of this family has been characterized as a regulator of RNase E [1] and its crystal structure has been analyzed [2].
CC  This model was initially classified as a "hypothetical equivalog" expressing the tentative hypothesis that all members might have the same function as the E. coli enzyme.  Considering the second clade of enterobacterial sequences within this family, that appears to be less tenable.  The function of these sequences outside of the narrow RraA equivalog model (TIGR02998) remains obscure.  All of these were initially annotated as MenG, AKA S-adenosylmethionine: 2-demethylmenaquinone methyltransferase (EC 2.1.-.-).  See the references characterizing this as a case of transitive annotation error [2,3] in the case of the E. coli protein.
