CC  Homoserine kinase is part of the threonine biosynthetic pathway.
CC  Homoserine kinase is a member of the GHMP kinases (Galactokinase, Homoserine kinase, Mevalonate kinase, Phosphomevalonate kinase) and shares with them an amino-terminal domain probably related to ATP binding.
CC  P.aeruginosa homoserine kinase seems not to be homologous (see PROSITE:PDOC0054)
