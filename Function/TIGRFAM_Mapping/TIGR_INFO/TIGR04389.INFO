CC  Members of this family are lipoproteins restricted (so far) to the genus Leptospira, sometimes with several paralogs clustered with each other, such as four in a row (out of six) in Leptospira interrogans str. UI 13372. The tandem set may be co-clustered with a putative structural protein that is usually the longest encoded by the leptospiral genome (and that often is an intein-containing protein).
