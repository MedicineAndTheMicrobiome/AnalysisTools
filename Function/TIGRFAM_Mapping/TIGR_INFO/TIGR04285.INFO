CC  This model describes nucleoid occlusion protein, a close homolog to ParB chromosome partitioning proteins including Spo0J in Bacillus subtilis. Its gene often is located near the gene for the Spo0J ortholog. This protein bind a specific DNA sequence and blocks cytokinesis from happening until chromosome segregation is complete.
