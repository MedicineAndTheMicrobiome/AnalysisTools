CC  This HMM represents a CRISPR-associated protein from the Dpsyc subtype, named for Desulfotalea psychrophila LSv54. CRISPR systems confer resistance in prokaryotes to invasive DNA or RNA, including phage and plasmids. CRISPR-associated proteins typically are found near CRISPR repeats and other CRISPR-associated proteins, have low levels of sequence identify, have sequence relationships that suggest lateral transfer, and show some sequence similarity to DNA-active proteins such as helicases and repair proteins.
