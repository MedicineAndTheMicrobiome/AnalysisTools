CC  This protein, MurQ, is involved in recycling components of the bacterial murein sacculus turned over during cell growth. The cell wall metabolite anhydro-N-acetylmuramic acid (anhMurNAc) is converted by a kinase, AnmK, to MurNAc-phosphate, then converted to N-acetylglucosamine-phosphate by this etherase, called MurQ. This family of proteins is similar to the C-terminal half of a number of vertebrate glucokinase regulator proteins and contains a Prosite pattern which is shared by this group of proteins in a region of local similarity.
