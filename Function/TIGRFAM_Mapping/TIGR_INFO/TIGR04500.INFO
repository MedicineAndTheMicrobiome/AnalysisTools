CC  Members of this protein family have a novel N-terminal sequence region. Close homologs to the C-terminal region of this protein score well to PpiC-type peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase models (see PF00639), yet no sequence within the family scores well to such models, suggesting origin within a branch of the PpiC family but subsequent neofunctionalization with a rapid change of sequence. The genome context for members always includes an ATP-grasp enzyme associated with peptide modification and a short polypeptide likely to be the modification target.
