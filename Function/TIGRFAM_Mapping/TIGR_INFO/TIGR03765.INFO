CC  This model describes a protein family exemplified by PFL_4695 of Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf-5. Full-length proteins in this family show some architectural variety, but this model represents a conserved domain. Most or all member proteins belong to laterally transferred chromosomal islands called integrative conjugative elements, or ICE.
