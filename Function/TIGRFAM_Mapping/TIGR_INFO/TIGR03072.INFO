CC  Members of this protein family are bacterial proteins homologous to peptide chain release factors 1 (RF-1, product of the prfA gene), and 2 (RF-2, product of the prfB gene). The member from Escherichia coli K-12, designated prfH, appears to be a pseudogene. This class I release factor is always found as the downstream gene of a two-gene operon.

RT  Diverse bacterial genomes encode an operon of two genes, one of which is an unusual class-I release factor that potentially recognizes atypical mRNA signals other than normal stop codons.
