CC  Members of this protein family are the single chain precursor of the two chains of the mature S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase as found in Methanocaldococcus jannaschii, Bacillus subtilis, and a wide range of other species. It differs substantially in architecture from the form as found in Escherichia coli, and lacks any extended homology to the eukaryotic form (TIGR00535).
