CC  Members of this protein family are 4-hydroxy-2-oxovalerate aldolase, also called  4-hydroxy-2-ketovalerate aldolase and 2-oxo-4-hydroxypentanoate aldolase. This enzyme, part of the pathway for the meta-cleavage of catechol, produces pyruvate and acetaldehyde. Acetaldehyde is then converted by acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (acylating) (DmpF; EC 1.2.1.10) to acetyl-CoA. The two enzymes are tightly associated.
