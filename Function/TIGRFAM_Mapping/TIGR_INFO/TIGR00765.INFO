CC  Initial identification of members of this protein family was based on characterization of the yihY gene product as ribonuclease BN in Escherichia coli. This identification has been withdrawn, as the group now finds the homolog in E. coli of RNase Z is the true ribonuclease BN rather than a strict functional equivalent of RNase Z. 
CC  Members of this subfamily include the largely uncharacterized BrkB (Bordetella resist killing by serum B) from Bordetella pertussis. Some members have an additional C-terminal domain. Paralogs from E. coli (yhjD) and Mycobactrium tuberculosis (Rv3335c) are part of a smaller, related subfamily that form their own cluster.
