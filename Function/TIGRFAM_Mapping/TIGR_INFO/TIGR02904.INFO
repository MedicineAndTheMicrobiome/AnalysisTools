CC  Members of this family are homologs of the Bacillus subtilis spore coat protein CotS. Members of this family, designated YsxE, are found only in the family Bacillaceae, from among the endospore-forming members of the Firmicutes branch of the Bacteria. As a rule, the ysxE gene is found immediately downstream of spoVID, a gene necessary for spore coat assembly. The protein has been shown to be part of the spore coat.
