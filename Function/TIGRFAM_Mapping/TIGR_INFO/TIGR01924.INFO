CC  This model describes the anti-sigma B factor also known as  serine-protein kinase RsbW. Sigma B controls the general stress regulon in B subtilis and is activated by cell stresses such as stationary phase and heat shock. RsbW binds to sigma B and prevents formation of the transcription complex at the promoter.[1] RsbV (anti-anti-sigma factor) binds to RsbW to inhibit association with sigma B, however RsbW can phosphorylate RsbV, causing disassociation of the RsbV/RsbW complex.[2] Low ATP level or environmental stress causes the dephosphorylation of RsbV.[3]
