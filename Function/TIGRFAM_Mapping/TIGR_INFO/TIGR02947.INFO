CC  This group of sigma factors are members of the sigma-70 family (TIGR02937).  They and appear by homology, tree building, bidirectional best hits and (with the exception of a paralog in Thermobifida fusca YX) one-to-a-genome distribution, to represent a conserved family.  This family is restricted to the Actinobacteria and each gene examined is followed by an anti-sigma factor in an apparent operon.
