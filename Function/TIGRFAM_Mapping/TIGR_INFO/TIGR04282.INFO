CC  Members of this protein family show strongly correlated phylogenetic distribution, and in most cases co-clustering, with an unusual radical SAM enzyme (TIGR04167) whose C-terminal PF12345 domain often contains a selenocysteine residue. Other members of the conserved gene neighborhood include another putative glycosyltransferase, an alkylhydroperoxidase family protein (TIGR04169), and a phosphoesterase family protein (TIGR04168). The cassette is likely to be biosynthetic but its exact function is unknown.
