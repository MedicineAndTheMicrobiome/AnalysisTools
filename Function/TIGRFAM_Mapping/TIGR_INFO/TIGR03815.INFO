CC  Members of this protein family belong to the MinD/ParA family of P-loop NTPases, and in particular show homology to the CpaE family of pilus assembly proteins (see PMID:12370432). Nearly all members are found, not only in a gene context consistent with pilus biogenesis or a pilus-like secretion apparatus, but also near a DEAD/DEAH-box helicase, suggesting an involvement in DNA transfer activity. The model describes a clade restricted to the Actinobacteria.
