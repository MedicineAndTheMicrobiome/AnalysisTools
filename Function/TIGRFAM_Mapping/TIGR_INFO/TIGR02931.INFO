CC  Nitrogenase is the enzyme of biological nitrogen fixation. The most wide-spread and most efficient nitrogenase contains a molybdenum cofactor. This protein family, AnfK, represents the beta subunit of the iron-only alternative nitrogenase. It is homologous to NifK and VnfK, of the molybdenum-containing and the vanadium (V)-containing types, respectively.
