CC  This HMM describes a very small (as short as 33 amino acids) protein of unknown function, essentially always found in an operon with CydAB, subunits of the cytochrome d terminal oxidase. It begins with an aromatic motif MWYFXW and appears to contain a membrane-spanning helix. This protein appears to be restricted to the Proteobacteria and exist in a single copy only. We suggest it may be a membrane subunit of the terminal oxidase. The family is named after the E. coli member YbgT (SP|P56100). This model excludes the apparently related protein YccB (SP|P24244).
