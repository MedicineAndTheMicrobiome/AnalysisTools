TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  This domain is in the N-terminal (relaxase) region of TrwC, a relaxase-helicase that acts in plasmid R388 conjugation. The relaxase domain has DNA cleavage and strand transfer activities. Plasmid transfer protein TraI is also a member of this domain family. Members of this family on bacterial chromosomes typically are found near other genes typical of conjugative plasmids and appear to mark integrated plasmids.
