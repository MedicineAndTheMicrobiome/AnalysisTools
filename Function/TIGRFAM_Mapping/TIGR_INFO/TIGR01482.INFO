CC  This HMM includes both the members of the SPP equivalog
CC  model (TIGR01485), encompassing plants and cyanobacteria, as well as those archaeal sequences which are the closest relatives (TIGR01487). It remains to be shown whether these archaeal sequences
CC  catalyze the same reaction as SPP.
