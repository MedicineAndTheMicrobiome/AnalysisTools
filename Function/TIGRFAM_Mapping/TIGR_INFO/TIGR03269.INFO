CC  The enzyme that catalyzes the final step in methanogenesis, methyl coenzyme M reductase, contains alpha, beta, and gamma chains. In older literature, the complex of alpha, beta, and gamma chains was termed component C, while this single chain protein was termed methyl coenzyme M reductase system component A2.
