CC  Members of this family are FadR, a transcriptional regulator of fatty acid metabolism, including both biosynthesis and beta-oxidation. It is found exclusively in a subset of Gammaproteobacteria, with strictly one copy per genome. It has an N-terminal DNA-binding domain and a less well conserved C-terminal long chain acyl-CoA-binding domain. FadR from this family heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli show differences in regulatory response and fatty acid binding profiles. The family is nevertheless designated equivalog, as all member proteins have at least nominally the same function.
