CC  Many peptide-modifying radical SAM enzymes have two 4Fe4S-binding regions, an N-terminal one recognized by Pfam radical SAM domain-defining model PF04055 and a C-terminal one recognized by TIGR04085. Members of this protein family occur in cassettes with such a radical SAM family (TIGR04148) and with a peptide modification target (TIGR04149). Surprisingly, members of this family show full-length homology to each other, with several scoring at least borderline hits to both PF04055 and TIGR04085, and yet differ in the presence/absence of a signature CX(3)CX(2)CX(9)C motif. Instead, members are best-conserved in the TIGR04085-like C-terminal region. Therefore, this protein family is designated a pseudo-radical-SAM protein, which likely works in partnership with a TIGR04148 family protein.
