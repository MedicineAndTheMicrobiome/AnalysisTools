CC  Members of this protein family are most closely related to TIGR02764, a subset of polysaccharide deacetylase family proteins found in a species if and only if the species forms endospores like those of Bacillus subtilis or Clostridium tetani. This family is likewise restricted to spore-formers, but is not universal among them in having sequences with full-length matches to the model.
