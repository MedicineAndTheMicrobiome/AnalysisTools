CC  The sporulation-specific transcription factor sigma-K (also called sigma-27) is expressed in the mother cell compartment of endospore-forming bacteria such as Bacillus subtilis. Like its close homolog sigma-E (sigma-29) (see TIGR02835), also specific to the mother cell compartment, it must be activated by a proteolytic cleavage. Note that in Bacillus subtilis (and apparently also Clostridium tetani), but not in other endospore forming species such as Bacillus anthracis, the sigK gene is generated by a non-germline (mother cell only) chromosomal rearrangement that recombines coding regions for the N-terminal and C-terminal regions of sigma-K.
