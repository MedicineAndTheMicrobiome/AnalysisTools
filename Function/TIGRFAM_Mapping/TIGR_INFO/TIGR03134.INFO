CC  Members of this protein family are the gamma subunit of malonate decarboxylase. Malonate decarboxylase may be a soluble enzyme, or linked to membrane subunits and active as a sodium pump. In the malonate decarboxylase complex, the beta subunit appears to act as a malonyl-CoA decarboxylase, while the gamma subunit appears either to mediate subunit interaction or to act as a co-decarboxylase with the beta subunit. The beta and gamma subunits exhibit some local sequence similarity.
