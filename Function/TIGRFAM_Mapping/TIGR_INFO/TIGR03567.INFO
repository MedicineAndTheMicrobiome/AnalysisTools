CC  Members of this protein family use NAD(P)H to reduce FMN and regenerate FMNH2. Members include the homodimeric, NAD(P)H-dependent enzyme SsuE from Escherichia coli, which serves as a partner to an FMNH2-dependent alkanesulfonate monooxygenase. It is induced by sulfate starvation. The NADH-dependent enzyme MsuE from Pseudomonas aeruginosa is outside the scope of this model (see model TIGR03566).
