CC  The member of this family from Haemophilus influenzae, HI0074, has been shown by crystal structure to resemble nucleotidyltransferase substrate binding proteins. It forms a complex with HI0073, encoded by the adjacent gene and containing a nucleotidyltransferase nucleotide binding domain (PF01909).
