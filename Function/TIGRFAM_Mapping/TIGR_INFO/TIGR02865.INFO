CC  Stage II sporulation protein E (SpoIIE) is a multiple membrane spanning protein with two separable functions. It plays a role in the switch to polar cell division during sporulation. By means of it protein phosphatase activity, located in the C-terminal region, it activates sigma-F. All proteins that score above the trusted cutoff to this model are found in endospore-forming Gram-positive bacteria. Surprisingly, a sequence from the Cyanobacterium-like (and presumably non-spore-forming) photosynthesizer Heliobacillus mobilis is homologous, and scores between the trusted and noise cutoffs.
