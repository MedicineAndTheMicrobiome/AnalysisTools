CC  The tripeptide glutathione is an important reductant, e.g., for maintaining the cellular thiol/disulfide status and for protecting against reactive oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide. Glutathione-disulfide reductase regenerates reduced glutathione from oxidized glutathione (glutathione disulfide) + NADPH. This HMM represents one of two closely related subfamilies of glutathione-disulfide reductase. Both are closely related to trypanothione reductase, and separate models are built so each of the three can describe proteins with conserved function. This model describes glutathione-disulfide reductases of plants and some bacteria, including cyanobacteria.
