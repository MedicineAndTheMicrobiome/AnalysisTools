CC  This model represents that clade of F420-dependent hydrogenases (FRH) beta subunits [1] found exclusively and universally in methanogenic archaea.  This protein contains two 4Fe-4S cluster binding domains (PF00037) and scores above the trusted cutoff to model PF01058 for the "NADH ubiquinone oxidoreductase, 20 Kd subunit" family.
