CC  Trehalose is a glucose disaccharide that serves in many biological systems as a compatible solute for protection against hyperosmotic and thermal stress. This family describes trehalose-6-phosphate hydrolase, product of the treC (or treA) gene, which is often found together with a trehalose uptake transporter and a trehalose operon repressor.
