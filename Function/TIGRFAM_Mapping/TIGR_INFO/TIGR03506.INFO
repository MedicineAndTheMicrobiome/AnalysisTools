CC  This model encompasses three closely related flagellar proteins usually denoted FlgE, FlgF and FlgG.  The names have often been mis-assigned, however.  Three equivalog HMMs, TIGR02489, TIGR02490 and TIGR02488, respectively, separate the individual forms into three genome-context consistent groups.  The major differences between these genes are architectural, with variable central sections between relatively conserved N- and C-terminal domains.  More distantly related are two other flagellar apparatus familis, FlgC (TIGR01395) which consists of little else but the N-and C-terminal domains and FlgK (TIGR02492) with a substantial but different central domain.
