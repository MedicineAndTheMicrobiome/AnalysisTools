CC  This HMM represents a family of at least two different sugar 1,4 lactone oxidases, both involved in synthesizing ascorbic acid or a derivative. These include L-gulonolactone oxidase (EC 1.1.3.8) from rat and D-arabinono-1,4-lactone oxidase (EC 1.1.3.37) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Members are proposed to have the cofactor FAD covalently bound at a site specified by Prosite motif PS00862; OX2_COVAL_FAD; 1.
