CC  Members of this protein family are the Fe-S protein, NrfC, of a cytochrome c nitrite reductase system for which the pentaheme cytochrome c protein, NrfB (family TIGR03146) is an unambiguous marker. Members of this protein family show similarity to other ferredoxin-like proteins, including a subunit of a polysulfide reductase.
