CC  Members of this protein family are found in mobization-related contexts more often than not, including within a CRISPR-associated gene region in Geobacter sulfurreducens PCA, and on plasmids in  Agrobacterium tumefaciens and Coxiella burnetii, always together with mobile mystery protein B, a member of the Fic protein family (PF02661). This protein is encoded by the upstream member of the gene pair and belongs to a family of helix-turn-helix DNA binding proteins (PF01381).
