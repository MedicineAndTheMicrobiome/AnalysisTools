CC  Members of this family represent a set of radical SAM enzymes related to, yet architecturally different from, the activating protein for the glycine radical-containing, oxygen-sensitive ribonucleoside-triphosphate reductase (RNR) as described in model TIGR02491. Members of this family are found paired with members of a similarly divergent set of anaerobic ribonucleoside-triphosphate reductases. Identification of this protein as an RNR activitating protein is partly from pairing with a candidate RNR. It is further supported by our finding that upstream of these operons are examples of a conserved regulatory element (described Rodionov and Gelfand) that is found in nearly all bacteria and that occurs specifically upstream of operons for all three classes of RNR genes.
