EC  2.5.1.-

CC  A fairly deep split separates this polyprenyltransferase subfamily from the set of mitochondrial and proteobacterial 4-hydroxybenzoate polyprenyltransferases, described in TIGR01474. Protoheme IX farnesyltransferase (heme O synthase) (TIGR01473) is more distantly related. Because no species appears to have both this protein and a member of TIGR01474, it is likely that this HMM represents 4-hydroxybenzoate polyprenyltransferase, a critical enzyme of ubiquinone biosynthesis, in the Archaea, Gram-positive bacteria,  Aquifex aeolicus, the Chlamydias, etc.
