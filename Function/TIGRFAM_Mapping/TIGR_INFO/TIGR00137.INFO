CC  This model represents an orthologous set of proteins present in relatively few bacteria but very tightly conserved where it occurs. It is closely related to gidA (glucose-inhibited division protein A), which appears to be present in all complete eubacterial genomes so far and in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. It was designated gid but is now recognized as a tRNA:m(5)U-54 methyltransferase and is now designated trmFO.
