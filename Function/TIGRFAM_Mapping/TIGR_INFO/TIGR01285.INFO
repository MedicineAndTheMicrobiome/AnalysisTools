CC  This protein forms a complex with NifE, and appears as a NifEN in some species. NifEN is a required for producing the molybdenum-iron cofactor of molybdenum-requiring nitrogenases. NifN is closely related to the nitrogenase  molybdenum-iron protein beta chain NifK. This model describes most examples of NifN but excludes some cases, such as the putative NifN of Chlorobium tepidum, for which a separate model may be created.
