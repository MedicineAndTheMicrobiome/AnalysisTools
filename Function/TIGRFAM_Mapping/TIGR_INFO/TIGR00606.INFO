CC  All proteins in this family for which functions are known are involved
CC  in recombination, recombinational repair, and/or non-homologous end joining.
CC  They are components of an exonuclease complex with MRE11 homologs.  This family is distantly related to the SbcC family of bacterial proteins.
CC  This family is based on the phylogenomic analysis of JA Eisen (1999, Ph.D. Thesis, Stanford University).
