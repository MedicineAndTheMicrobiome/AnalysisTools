CC  This family consists of fungal proteins of unknown function associated with secondary metabolite biosynthesis, such as of the ergot alkaloids such as ergovaline. Nomenclature differs because gene order differs - this is EasG in Neotyphodium lolii but is designated ergot alkaloid biosynthetic protein A in several other fungi.
