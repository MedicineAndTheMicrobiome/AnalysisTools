CC  This protein is part of a large group of proteins involved in conjugative transfer of plasmid DNA, specifically the F-type system.  This protein has been predicted to contain a thioredoxin fold, contains a conserved pair of cysteines and has been shown to function as a thiol disulfide isomerase by complementation of an Ecoli DsbA defect [1].  The protein is believed to be involved in pilin assembly [2].  The protein is closely related to TraF (TIGR02739) which is somewhat longer, lacks the cysteine motif and is apparently not functional as a disulfide bond isomerase.
