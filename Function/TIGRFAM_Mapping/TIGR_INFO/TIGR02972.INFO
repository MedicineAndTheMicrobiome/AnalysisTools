CC  Members of this small, apparent transmembrane protein are designated TorE and occur in operons for the trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) reductase system. Members are closely related to the NapE protein of the related periplasmic nitrate reductase system. It may be that TorE is an integral membrane subunit of a complex with the reductase TorA.
