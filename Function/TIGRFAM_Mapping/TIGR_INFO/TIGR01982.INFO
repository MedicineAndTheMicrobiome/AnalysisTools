CC  This model represents the enzyme (UbiB) which catalyzes the first hydroxylation step in the ubiquinone biosynthetic pathway in bacteria [1,2].  It is believed that the reaction is 2-polyprenylphenol -> 6-hydroxy-2-polyprenylphenol.  This model finds hits primarily in the proteobacteria.  The gene is also known as AarF in certain species.
