CC  Bacteriocins are bacterial peptide products toxic to closely related bacteria. This model represents the N-terminal region up to the GG cleavage motif. Processing to remove this bacteriocin leader peptide occurs together with export by an ABC transporter. Note: because this model is so small (15 amino acids), it may have many spurious high-scoring matches to unrelated proteins, even with fairly stringent cutoff scores. The most likely true positives are small proteins of Gram-positive bacteria, matching regions that start within the first 15 amino acids, and encoded near bacteriocin transport family proteins (TIGR01000, TIGR01193).
