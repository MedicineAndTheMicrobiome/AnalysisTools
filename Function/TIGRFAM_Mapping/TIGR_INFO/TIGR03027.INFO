CC  This protein family belongs to the larger set of polysaccharide biosynthesis/export proteins described by Pfam model PF02563. Members of this family are variable in either containing of lacking a 78-residue insert, but appear to fall within a single clade, nevertheless, where the regions in which the gene is found encode components of the PEP-CTERM/EpsH proposed exosortase protein sorting system.
