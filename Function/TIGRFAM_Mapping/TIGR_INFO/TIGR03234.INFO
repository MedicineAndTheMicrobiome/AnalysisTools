CC  This enzyme interconverts tartronate semi-aldehyde (TSA, aka 2-hydroxy 3-oxopropionate) and hydroxypyruvate.  The E. coli enzyme has been characterized [1] and found to be specific for TSA, contain no cofactors, and have a rather high Km for hydroxypyruvate of 12.5 mM.  The gene is ofter found in association with glyoxalate carboligase (which produces TSA), but has been shown to have no effect on growth on glyoxalate when knocked out [2].  This is consistent with the fact that the gene for tartronate semialdehyde reductase (glxR) is also associated and may have primary responsibility for the catabolism of TSA.
