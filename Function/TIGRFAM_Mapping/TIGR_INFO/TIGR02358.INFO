CC  On the basis of a phylogenomic study of thiamine biosythetic, salvage, and transporter genes and a highly conserved RNA element THI, this protein family has been identified as a probable transporter of hydroxymethylpyrimidine (HMP), the phosphorylated (by ThiD) form of which gets joined (by ThiE) to hydroxyethylthiazole phosphate to make thiamine phosphate.
