CC  Members of this protein family are the bacterial ATP-dependent chaperone ClpB. This protein belongs to the AAA family, ATPases associated with various cellular activities (PF00004). This molecular chaperone does not act as a protease, but rather serves to disaggregate misfolded and aggregated proteins.
