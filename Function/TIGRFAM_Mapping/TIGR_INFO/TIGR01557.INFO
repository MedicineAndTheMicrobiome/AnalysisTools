TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  This HMM describes a DNA-binding domain restricted to (but common in) plant proteins, many of which also contain a response regulator domain. The domain appears related to the Myb-like DNA-binding domain described by Pfam model PF00249. It is distinguished in part by a well-conserved motif SH[AL]QKY[RF] at the C-terminal end of the motif.
