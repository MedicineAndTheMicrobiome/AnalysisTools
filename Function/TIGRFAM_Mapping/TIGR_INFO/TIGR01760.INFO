EN  phage tail tape measure protein, TP901 family, core region
TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  This HMM represents a reasonably well conserved core region of a family of phage tail proteins. The member from phage TP901-1 was characterized as a tail length tape measure protein in that a shortened form of the protein leads to phage with proportionately shorter tails.
