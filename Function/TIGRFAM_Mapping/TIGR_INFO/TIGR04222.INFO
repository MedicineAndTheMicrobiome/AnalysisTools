CC  The majority of the proteins with a domain as described by this model have an extreme C-terminal sequence that is consists of extremely low-complexity sequence, rich in Ser or in Gly interspersed with Cys. That C-terminal region resembles ribosomal natural product precursors, although there is no evidence that C-terminal regions of these proteins undergo any modification or have any such function.
