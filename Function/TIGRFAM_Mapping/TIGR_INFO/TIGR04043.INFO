CC  Members of this protein family are radical SAM proteins related to MSMEG_0568 from Mycobacterium smegmatis. Members occur within 8-gene operons in species as diverse as M. smegmatis, Rhizobium leguminosarum, Synechococcus elongatus, and Sorangium cellulosum. The function of the operon is unknown, but similarity of MSMEG_0568 to some cofactor biosynthesis radical SAM proteins suggests a similar biosynthetic function.
