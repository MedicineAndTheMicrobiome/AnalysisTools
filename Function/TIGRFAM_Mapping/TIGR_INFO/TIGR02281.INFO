CC  This family consists of predicted aspartic proteases, typically from 180 to 230 amino acids in length, in MEROPS clan AA. This model describes the well-conserved 121-residue C-terminal region. The poorly conserved, variable length N-terminal region usually contains a predicted transmembrane helix. Sequences in the seed alignment and those scoring above the trusted cutoff are Proteobacterial; homologs scroing between trusted and noise are found in Pyrobaculum aerophilum str. IM2 (archaeal), Pirellula sp. (Planctomycetes), and Nostoc sp. PCC 7120 (Cyanobacteria).
