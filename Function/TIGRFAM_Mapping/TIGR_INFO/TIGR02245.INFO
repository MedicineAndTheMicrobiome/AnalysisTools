EN  HAD-superfamily subfamily IIID hydrolase, TIGR02245
TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  This family of sequences appears to belong to the Haloacid Dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily of enzymes by virtue of the presence of three catalytic domains [1], in this case: LLVLD(ILV)D(YH)T, I(VMG)IWS, and (DN)(VC)K(PA)Lx{15-17}T(IL)(MH)(FV)DD(IL)(GRS)(RK)N.  Since this family has no large "cap" domain [2] between motifs 1 and 2 or between 2 and 3, it is formally a "class III" HAD [3].
