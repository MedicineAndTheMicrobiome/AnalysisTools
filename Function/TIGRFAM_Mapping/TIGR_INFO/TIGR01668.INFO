CC  This family of hypothetical proteins is a member of the IIIA subfamily of the haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily of hydrolases.  All characterized members of this subfamily (TIGR01662) and most characterized members of the HAD superfamily are phosphatases.  HAD superfamily phosphatases contain active site residues in several conserved catalytic motifs [1], all of which are found conserved here.
CC  This family consists of sequences from fungi, plants, cyanobacteria, gram-positive bacteria and Deinococcus.  There is presently no characterization of any sequence in this family.
