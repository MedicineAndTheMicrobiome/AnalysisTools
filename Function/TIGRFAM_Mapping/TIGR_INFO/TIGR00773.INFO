CC  These proteins are members of the NhaA Na+:H+ Antiporter (NhaA) Family (TC. 2.A.33).  The Escherichia coli NhaA protein probably functions in the regulation of the internal pH when the external pH is alkaline. It also uses the H+ gradient to expel Na+ from the cell. Its activity is highly pH dependent. Only the E. coli protein is functionally and structurally well characterized.
