CC  The proteins in this family are homologs of the EpsG protein found in Methylobacillus strain 12S and are generally found in operons with other Eps homologs.  The protein is believed to function as the protein tyrosine kinase component of the chain length regulator (along with the transmembrane component EpsF).
