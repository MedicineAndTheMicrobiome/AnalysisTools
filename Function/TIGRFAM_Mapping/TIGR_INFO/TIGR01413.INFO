CC  A defined member of this superfamily is Dyp, a dye-decolorizing peroxidase that lacks a typical heme-binding region. A distinct, uncharacterized branch (TIGR01412) of this superfamily has a typical twin-arginine
CC  dependent signal sequence characteristic of exported proteins with bound redox cofactors.
