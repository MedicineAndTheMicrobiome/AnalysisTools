CC  This HMM describes a number of closely related proteins with the phosphosugar-binding domain SIS (Sugar ISomerase) followed by two copies of the CBS (named after Cystathionine Beta Synthase) domain. One is GutQ, a protein of the glucitol operon. Another is KpsF, a virulence factor involved in capsular polysialic acid biosynthesis in some pathogenic strains of E. coli.
