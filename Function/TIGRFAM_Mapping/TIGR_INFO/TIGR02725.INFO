CC  Members of this protein family are the gamma subunit of phenylphosphate carboxylase. Phenol (methyl-benzene) is converted to phenylphosphate, then para-carboxylated by this four-subunit enzyme, with the release of phosphate, to 4-hydroxybenzoate. The enzyme contains neither biotin nor thiamin pyrophosphate. The gamma subunit has no known homologs.
