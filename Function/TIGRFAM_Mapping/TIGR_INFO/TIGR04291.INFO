CC  The broader family (TIGR00345) to which the current family belongs consists of transport-energizing ATPases, including to TRC40/GET3 family involved in post-translational insertion of protein C-terminal transmembrane anchors into membranes from the cyotosolic face. This family, however, is restricted to ATPases that energize pumps that export arsenite (or antimonite).
