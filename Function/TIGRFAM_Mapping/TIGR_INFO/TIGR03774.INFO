CC  This HMM describes protein translations of a second family, RPE2, of Rickettsia palindromic elements (RPE). The elements spread within a genome as selfish genetic elements, inserting into genes additional coding regions that does not disrupt the reading frame. This model finds RPE-encoded regions in several Rickettsial species and, so far, no where else.
