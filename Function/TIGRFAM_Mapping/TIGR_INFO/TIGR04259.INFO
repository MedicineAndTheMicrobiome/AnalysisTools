CC  This model represents a subgroup of the more broadly defined model TIGR00890, which in turn belongs to the Major Facilitator transporter family. Seed members for this family include the known oxalate/formate antiporter of Oxalobacter formigenes, as well as transporter subunits co-clustered with the two genes of a system that decarboxylates oxalate into formate. In many of these cassettes, two subunits are found rather than one, suggesting the antiporter is sometimes homodimeric, sometimes heterodimeric.
