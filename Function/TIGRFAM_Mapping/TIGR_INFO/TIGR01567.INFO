CC  This HMM represents a sequence region found tandemly duplicated in two proven archaeal S-layer glycoproteins, MA0829 from Methanosarcina acetivorans C2A and MM1976 from Methanosarcina mazei Go1, as well as in several paralogs of those L-layer proteins  from both species. Members of the family show regions of local similarity to another known family of archaeal S-layer proteins described by model TIGR01564. Some members of this family, including the proven S-layer proteins, have the archaeosortase A target motif, PGF-CTERM (TIGR04126), at the protein C-terminus.
