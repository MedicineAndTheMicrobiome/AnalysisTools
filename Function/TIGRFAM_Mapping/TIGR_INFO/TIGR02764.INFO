CC  This model describes the YbaN protein family, also called PdaB and SpoVIE, of Gram-positive bacteria. Although ybaN null mutants have only a mild sporulation defect, ybaN/ytrI double mutants show drastically reducted sporulation efficiencies. This synthetic defect suggests the role of this sigmaE-controlled gene in sporulation had been masked by functional redundancy. Members of this family are homologous to a characterized polysaccharide deacetylase; the exact function this protein family is unknown.
