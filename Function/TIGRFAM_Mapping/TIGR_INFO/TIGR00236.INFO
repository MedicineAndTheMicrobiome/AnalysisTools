CC  This cytosolic enzyme converts UDP-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine to UDP-N-acetyl-D-mannosamine. In E. coli, this is the first step in the pathway of enterobacterial common antigen biosynthesis.
CC  Members of this orthology group have many gene symbols, often reflecting the overall activity of the pathway and/or operon that includes it. Symbols include epsC (exopolysaccharide C) in Burkholderia solanacerum, cap8P (type 8 capsule P) in Staphylococcus aureus, and nfrC in an older designation based on the effects of deletion on phage N4 adsorption. 
CC  Epimerase activity was also demonstrated in a bifunctional rat enzyme, for which the N-terminal domain appears to be orthologous. The set of proteins found above the suggested cutoff includes E. coli WecB in one of two deeply branched clusters and the rat UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase domain in the other.
