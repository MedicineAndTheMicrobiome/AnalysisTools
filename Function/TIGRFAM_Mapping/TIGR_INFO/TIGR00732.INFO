CC  Disruption of this gene in both Haemophilus influenzae and Helicobacter pylori drastically reduces the efficiency of transformation with exogenous DNA, but with different levels of effect on chromosomal (linear) and plasmid (circular) DNA [1][2]. This difference suggests the DprA is not active in recombination, and it has been shown not to affect DNA binding, leaving the intermediate step in natural transformation, DNA processing. In Strep. pneumoniae, inactivation of dprA had no effect on the uptake of DNA [3]. All of these data indicated that DprA is required at a later stage in transformation.  Subsequently DprA and RecA were both shown in S. pneumoniae to be required to protect incoming ssDNA from immediate degradation. [4].   Role of DprA in non-transformable species is not known. The gene symbol smf was assigned in E. coli, but without assignment of function.
