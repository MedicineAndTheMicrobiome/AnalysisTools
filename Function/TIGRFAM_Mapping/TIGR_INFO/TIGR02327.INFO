CC  Members of this protein family are small, typically about 80 residues in length, and are highly hydrophobic. The gene is found so far only in a subset of the Firmicutes in association with genes of the ATP synthase F1 complex or NADH-quinone oxidoreductase. This family includes ywzB from Bacillus subtilis; Pfam model PF06612 describes the same family as Protein of unknown function DUF1146.
