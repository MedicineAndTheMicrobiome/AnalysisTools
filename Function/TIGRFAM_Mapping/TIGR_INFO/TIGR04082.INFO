CC  Members of this protein family are radical SAM (rSAM) enzymes similar in sequence to others with known or postulated roles in peptide modification, and regularly found adjacent to members of the GSU_1558 peptide family described by model TIGR04081. GSU_1558 and several other members of that family appear to be selenoproteins, hence the term selenobiotic.
