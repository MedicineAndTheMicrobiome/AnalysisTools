CC  The HPr family are bacterial proteins (or domains of proteins) which function in phosphoryl transfer system (PTS) systems. They include energy-coupling components which catalyze sugar uptake via a group translocation mechanism. The functions of most of these proteins are not known, but they presumably function in PTS-related regulatory capacities. All seed members are stand-alone HPr proteins, although the model also recognizes HPr domains of PTS fusion proteins. This family includes the related NPr protein.
