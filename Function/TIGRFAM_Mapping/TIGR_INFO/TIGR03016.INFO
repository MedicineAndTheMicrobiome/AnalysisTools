CC  Members of this protein family are found predominantly in exopolysaccharide biosynthesis operons marked by the presence of the EpsH-family putative exosortase and presence in the genome of the PEP-CTERM protein sorting signal. Members of this family may be distantly related to the EpsL family modeled in TIGR03014.
