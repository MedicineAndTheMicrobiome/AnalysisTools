CC  This model finds the subfamily of distantly related, low complexity, hydrophobic small subunits of several related sodium ion-pumping decarboxylases. These include oxaloacetate decarboxylase gamma subunit and methylmalonyl-CoA decarboxylase delta subunit.
CC  Most sequences scoring between the noise and trusted cutoffs are eukaryotic sodium channel proteins.
