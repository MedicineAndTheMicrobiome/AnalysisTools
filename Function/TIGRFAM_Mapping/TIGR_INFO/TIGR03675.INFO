TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  This family of proteins is universal in the archaea and consistsof an N-terminal type-1 KH-domain (PF00013) a central beta-lactamase-domain (PF00753) with a C-terminal motif associated with RNA metabolism (PF07521).  KH-domains are associated with RNA-binding, so taken together, this protein is a likely metal-dependent RNAase.  This family was defined in [1] as arCOG01782.
