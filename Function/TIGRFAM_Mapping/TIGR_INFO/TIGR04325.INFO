CC  Members of this family tend to occur next to glycosyltransferases and other characteristic enzymes of O-antigen biosynthetic regions. The founding member is LIC12133 from Leptospira interrogans serovar Copenhageni. PSI-BLAST reveals distant homology to known SAM-dependent methyltransferases, as in Pfam family PF13489.
