CC  Members of this family are NifX proteins encoded within operons for nitrogen fixation in a number of bacteria. NifX, NafY, and the C-terminal region of NifB all belong to the Pfam family PF02579 and are involved in MoFe cofactor biosynthesis. NifX is a nitrogenase accessory protein with a role in expression of the MoFe cofactor.
