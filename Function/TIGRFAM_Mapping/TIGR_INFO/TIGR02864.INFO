CC  This model represents a minor (low-abundance) spore protein, designated SspO. It is found in a very limited subset of the already small group of endospore-forming bacteria, but these species include Oceanobacillus iheyensis, Geobacillus kaustophilus, Bacillus subtilis, B. halodurans, and B. cereus. This protein was previously called CotK.
