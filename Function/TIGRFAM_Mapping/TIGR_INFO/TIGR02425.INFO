CC  Members of this family are 4-carboxymuconolactone decarboxylase, which catalyzes the third step in the catabolism of protocatechuate (and therefore the fourth step in the catabolism of para-hydroxybenzoate, of 3-hydroxybenzoate, of vanillate, etc.). Most members of this family are encoded within protocatechuate catabolism operons. This protein is sometimes found as a fusion protein with other enzymes of the pathway, as in Rhodococcus opacus, Streptomyces avermitilis, and Caulobacter crescentus.
