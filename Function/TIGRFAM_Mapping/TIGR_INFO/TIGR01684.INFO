CC  This model represents a family of viral proteins of unknown function.  These proteins are members, however, of the IIIC (TIGR01681) subfamily of the haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily of aspartate nucleophile hydrolases.  All characterized members of the III subfamilies (IIIA, TIGR01662; IIIB, PF03767) are phosphatases, including MDP-1, a member of subfamily IIIC (TIGR01681) [1].  No member of this subfamily is characterized with respect to particular function.  All of the active site residues characteristic of HAD-superfamily phosphatases [2] are present in subfamily IIIC.
CC  These proteins also include an N-terminal domain (ca. 125 aas) that is unique (by HMM) to this clade.
