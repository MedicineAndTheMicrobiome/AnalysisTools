CC  This family includes proteins from pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria, Homo sapiens and Drosophila. In Bacillus cereus, a pathogen, it has been show to function as a channel-forming cytolysin. The human protein is expressed preferentially in mature macrophages, consistent with a role cytolytic role.
