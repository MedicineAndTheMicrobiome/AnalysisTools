CC  This HMM represents a family of fused B and C components of PTS enzyme II.  This clade is a member of a larger family which contains enzyme II's specific for a variety of sugars including glucose (TIGR02002) and N-acetylglucosamine (TIGR01998).  None of the members of this clade have been experimentally characterized.  This clade includes sequences from Streptococcus and Enterococcus which also include a C-terminal A domain as well as Bacillus and Clostridium which do not.  In nearly all cases, these species also contain an authentic glucose-specific PTS transporter.
