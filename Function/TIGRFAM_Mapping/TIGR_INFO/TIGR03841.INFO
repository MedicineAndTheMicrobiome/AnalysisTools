CC  This model describes a small family of enzymes in the bacterial luciferase-like monooxygenase family, which includes F420-dependent enzymes such as N5,N10-methylenetetrahydromethanopterin reductase as well as FMN-dependent enzymes. All members of this family are from species that produce coenzyme F420; SIMBAL analysis suggests that members of this family bind F420 rather than FMN.
