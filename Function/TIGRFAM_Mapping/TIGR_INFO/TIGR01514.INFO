CC  This HMM represents nicotinate phosphoribosyltransferase, the first enzyme in the salvage pathway of NAD biosynthesis from nicontinate (niacin). Members are primary proteobacterial but also include yeasts and Methanosarcina acetivorans.  A related family, apparently non-overlapping in species distribution, is TIGR01513. Members of that family differ in substantially in sequence and have a long C-terminal extension missing from this family, but are proposed also to act as nicotinate phosphoribosyltransferase (see model TIGR01513).
