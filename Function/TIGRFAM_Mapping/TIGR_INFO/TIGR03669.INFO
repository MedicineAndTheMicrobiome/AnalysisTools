TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  Members of this protein family are identified as the substrate-binding protein of a urea ABC transport system by similarity to a known urea transporter from Corynebacterium glutamicum, operon structure, proximity of its operons to urease (urea-utilization protein) operons, and by Partial Phylogenetic Profiling vs. urea utilization.
