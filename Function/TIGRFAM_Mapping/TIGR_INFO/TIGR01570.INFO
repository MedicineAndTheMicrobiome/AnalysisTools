CC  This HMM represents a region of about 170 amino acids found at the C-terminus of a family of plant proteins. These proteins typically have additional highly divergent N-terminal regions rich in low complexity sequence. PSI-BLAST reveals no clear similarity to any characterized protein. At least 12 distinct members are found in Arabidopsis thaliana.
