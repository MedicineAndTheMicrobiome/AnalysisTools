CC  This model detects 3-dehydroquinate dehydratase, type I, either as a monofunctional protein or as a domain of a larger, multifunctional protein. It is often found fused to shikimate 5-dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.25), and sometimes additional domains.
CC  Type II 3-dehydroquinate dehydratase, designated AroQ, is described by the HMM TIGR01088.
