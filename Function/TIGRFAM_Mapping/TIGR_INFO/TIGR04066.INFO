EN  peptide maturation system protein, TIGR04066 family
TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  Members of this protein family occur in various Clostridial genomes, always in the context of a short peptide and a radical SAM protein predicted to modify the short peptide. PSI-BLAST analysis suggests a sequence relationship to archaeal proteins designated as subunits of an H+-transporting two-sector ATPase. The modified peptide is likely to be a bacteriocin, and this protein is a candidate to act in either maturation or immunity.
