CC  Members of this family are the methionine salvage enzyme MnxX, a member of the HAD-superfamily hydrolases, subfamily IB (see TIGR01488). Members are found in Bacillus subtilis and related species, paired with MtnW (TIGR03332). In most species that recycle methionine from methylthioadenosine, the single protein MtnC replaces the MtnW/MtnX pair. In B. subtilis, mtnX  was first known as ykrX.
