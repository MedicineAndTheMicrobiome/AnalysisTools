CC  This protein family is restricted to the Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus lineages of the Cyanobacteria, and is sporadic in those lineages. Members average 100 amino acids in length, including a 30-residue, highly polar, low complexity region sandwiched between an N-terminal region of about 60 residues and a C-terminal [KR]VVR[KR]RS motif, both well-conserved. The function is unknown.
