CC  The leucyl-tRNA synthetases belong to two families so broadly different that they are represented by separate models. This model includes both archaeal and cytosolic eukaryotic leucyl-tRNA synthetases; the eubacterial and mitochondrial forms differ so substantially that some other tRNA ligases score higher by this model than does any eubacterial LeuS.
