CC  Although Pfam models PF07805 and PF07804 currently are called HipA-like N-terminal domain and HipA-like C-terminal domain, respectively, those models hit the central and C-terminal regions of E. coli HipA but not the N-terminal region. This model hits the N-terminal region of HipA and its homologs, and also identifies proteins that lack match regions for PF07804 and PF07805.
