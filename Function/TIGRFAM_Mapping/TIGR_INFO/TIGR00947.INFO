GS  ictB
TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  This family of proteins is suggested to transport inorganic carbon (HCO3-), based on the phenotype of a mutant of IctB in Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7942. Bicarbonate uptake is used by many photosynthetic organisms including cyanobacteria. These organisms are able to concentrate CO2/HCO3- against a greater than ten-fold concentration gradient. Cyanobacteria may have several such carriers operating with different efficiencies. Note that homology to various O-antigen ligases, with possible implications for mutant cell envelope structure, might allow alternatives to the interpretation of IctB as a bicarbonate transport protein.
