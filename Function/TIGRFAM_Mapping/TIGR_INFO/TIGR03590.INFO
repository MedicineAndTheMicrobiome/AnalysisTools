CC  This protein is found in association with enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of pseudaminic acid [1], a component of polysaccharide in certain Pseudomonas strains as well as a modification of flagellin in Campylobacter and Hellicobacter [1].  The role of this protein is unclear, although it may participate in N-acetylation in conjunction with, or in the absence of PseH (TIGR03585) as it often scores above the trusted cutoff to PF00583 representing a family of acetyltransferases.
