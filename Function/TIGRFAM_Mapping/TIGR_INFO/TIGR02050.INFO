CC  This family represents a division of a larger family, the other branch of which is predicted to act as glutamate--cysteine ligase (the first of two enzymes in glutathione biosynthesis) in the cyanobacteria.  Species containing this protein, however, are generally not believe to make glutathione, and the function is unknown.
