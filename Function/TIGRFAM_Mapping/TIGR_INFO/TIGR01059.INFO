CC  This model describes the common type II DNA topoisomerase (DNA gyrase). Two apparently independently arising families, one in the Proteobacteria and one in Gram-positive lineages, are both designated toposisomerase IV. Proteins scoring above the noise cutoff for this model and below the trusted cutoff for topoisomerase IV models probably should be designated GyrB.
