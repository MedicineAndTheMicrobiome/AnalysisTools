CC  The Escherichia coli YbbB protein was shown to encode a selenophosphate-dependent tRNA 2-selenouridine synthase, essential for modification of some tRNAs to replace a sulfur atom with selenium. This enzyme works with SelD, the selenium donor protein, which also acts in selenocysteine incorporation. Although the members of this protein family show a fairly deep split, sequences from both sides of the split are supported by co-occurence with, and often proximity to, the selD gene.
