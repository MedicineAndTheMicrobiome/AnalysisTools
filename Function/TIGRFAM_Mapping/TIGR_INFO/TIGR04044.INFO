CC  This model describes a family of proteins with remote similarity to the DsrE/DsrF-like family (see PF02635). All members are found in a context of at least seven genes that includes a radical SAM protein, suggesting biosynthesis. The system is sparsely but broadly distributed in bacteria, including Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Cyanobacteria.
