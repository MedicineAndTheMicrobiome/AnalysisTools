CC  This model represents a family of methyltransferases involved in the biosynthesis of menaquinone and ubiqinone.  Some members such as the UbiE enzyme from E. coli [1] are believed to act in both pathways, while others may act in only the menaquinone pathway.  These methyltransferases are members of the UbiE/CoQ family of methyltransferases (PF01209) which also contains ubiquinone methyltransferases and other methyltransferases.
CC  Members of this clade include a wide distribution of bacteria and eukaryotes, but no archaea.  An outgroup for this clade is provided by the phosphatidylethanolamine methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.17) from Rhodobacter sphaeroides [2].
CC  Note that a number of non-orthologous genes which are members of PF03737 have been erroneously annotated as MenG methyltransferases.
