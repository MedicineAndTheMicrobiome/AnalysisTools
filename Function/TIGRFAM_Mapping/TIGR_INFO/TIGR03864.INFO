CC  Members of this protein family are the ATP-binding subunit of an ABC transporter system that is associated with PQQ biosynthesis and PQQ-dependent alcohol dehydrogenases. While this family shows homology to several efflux ABC transporter subunits, the presence of a periplasmic substrate-binding protein and association with systems for catabolism of alcohols suggests a role in import rather than detoxification.
