CC  Various members of this family are characterized as the B subunits of succinyl-CoA:3-ketoacid-CoA transferase (EC 2.8.3.5), beta-ketoadipate:succinyl-CoA transferase (EC 2.8.3.6), acetyl-CoA:acetoacetate CoA transferase (EC 2.8.3.8), and butyrate-acetoacetate CoA-transferase (EC 2.8.3.9).  This represents a very distinct clade with strong sequence conservation within the larger family defined by Pfam model PF01144. The A subunit represents a different clade in PF01144.
