CC  This model represents one of two subunits/domains of the bifunctional isomerase/decarboxylase involved in 4-hydroxyphenylacetate degradation [1].  In E. coli and some other species this enzyme is encoded by a single polypeptide containing both this domain and the closely related N-terminal domain (TIGR02305).  In other species such as Pasteurella multocida these domains are found as two separate proteins (usually as tandem genes).  Together, these domains carry out the decarboxylation of 5-oxopent-3-ene-1,2,5-tricarboxylic acid (OPET) to 2-hydroxy-2,4-diene-1,7-dioate (HHDD) and the subsequent isomerization to 2-oxohept-3-ene-1,7-dioate (OHED).
