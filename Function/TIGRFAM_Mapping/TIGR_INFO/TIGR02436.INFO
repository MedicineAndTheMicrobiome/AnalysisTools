CC  This family describes a protein of unknown function whose structure is a bundle of four long alpha helices. Some of the first members of this family were found encoded in the (atypically large) intervening sequence (IVS) of Leptospira 23S RNA, a region often present in the rRNA gene and removed during rRNA processing without re-ligation. However, this location is not conserved, and naming this protein as a 23S RNA protein is both confusing and inaccurate.
