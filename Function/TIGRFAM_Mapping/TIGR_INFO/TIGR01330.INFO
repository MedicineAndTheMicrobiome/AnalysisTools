CC  Sulfate is incorporated into 3-phosphoadenylylsulfate, PAPS, for utilization in pathways such as methionine biosynthesis. Transfer of sulfate from PAPS to an acceptor leaves adenosine 3'-5'-bisphosphate, APS. This HMM describes a form found in plants of the enzyme 3'(2'),5'-bisphosphate nucleotidase, which removes the 3'-phosphate from APS to regenerate AMP and help drive the cycle. Sensitivity of this essential enzyme to sodium and other metal ions results is responsible for characterization of this enzyme as a salt tolerance protein.
CC  Some members of this family are active also as inositol 1-monophosphatase.
