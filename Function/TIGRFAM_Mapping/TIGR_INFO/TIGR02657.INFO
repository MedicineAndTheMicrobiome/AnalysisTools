CC  Members of this family are amicyanin, a type I blue copper protein that accepts electrons from the tryptophan tryptophylquinone (TTQ) cofactor of the methylamine dehydrogenase light chain and then transfers them to the heme group of cytochrome c-551i. Amicyanin, methylamine dehydrogenase, and  cytochrome c-551i are periplasmic and form a complex. This system has been studied primarily in Paracoccus denitrificans and Methylobacterium extorquens. Related type I blue copper proteins include plastocyanin, pseudoazurin, halocyanin, etc.
