CC  Prolyl-tRNA synthetase is a class II tRNA synthetase and is recognized by pfam HMM tRNA-synt_2b, which recognizes tRNA synthetases for Gly, His, Ser, and Pro. The prolyl-tRNA synthetases are divided into two widely divergent families. This family includes the archaeal enzyme, the Pro-specific domain of a human multifunctional tRNA ligase, and the enzyme from the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi. The other family includes enzymes from Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Synechocystis PCC6803, and one of the two prolyL-tRNA synthetases of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
