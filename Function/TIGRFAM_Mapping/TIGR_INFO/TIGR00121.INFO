CC  This model represents the biotin--acetyl-CoA-carboxylase ligase region of biotin--acetyl-CoA-carboxylase ligase. In Escherichia coli and some other species, this enzyme is part of a bifunction protein BirA that includes a small, N-terminal biotin operon repressor domain. Proteins identified by this model should not be called bifunctional unless they are also identified by birA_repr_reg (TIGR00122).
CC  The protein name suggests that this enzyme transfers biotin only to acetyl-CoA-carboxylase but it also transfers the biotin moiety to other proteins. The apparent orthologs among the eukaryotes are larger proteins that contain a single copy of this domain.
