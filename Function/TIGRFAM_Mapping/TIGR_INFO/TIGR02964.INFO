CC  Members of this protein family are the accessory protein XdhC for insertion of the molybdenum cofactor into the xanthine dehydrogenase large chain, XdhB, in bacteria. This protein is not part of the mature xanthine dehydrogenase. Xanthine dehydrogenase is an enzyme for purine catabolism, from other purines to xanthine to urate to further breakdown products.
