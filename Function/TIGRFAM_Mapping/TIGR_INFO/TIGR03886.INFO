CC  This uncharacterized radical SAM domain protein occurs rarely and sporadically in species that include select Alphaproteobacteria and Actinobacteria, and in Deinococcus deserti VCD115. It is a distant but full-length homolog to the Bacillus subtilis spore photoproduct lyase (spl), which monomerizes thymine dimers created as DNA damage by uv radiation.
