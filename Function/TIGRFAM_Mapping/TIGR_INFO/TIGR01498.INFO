CC  This HMM describes the folate biosynthesis enzyme 2-amino-4-hydroxy-6-hydroxymethyldihydropteridine pyrophosphokinase. Alternate names include 6-hydroxymethyl-7,8-dihydropterin diphosphokinase and 7,8-dihydro-6-hydroxymethylpterin pyrophosphokinase (HPPK). The extreme C-terminal region, of typically eight to thirty residues, is not included in the model. This enzyme may be found as a fusion protein with other enzymes of folate biosynthesis.
