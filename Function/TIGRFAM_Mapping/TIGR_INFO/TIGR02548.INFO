CC  CRISPR is a term for Clustered, Regularly Interspaced Short Palidromic Repeats. A number of protein families appear only in association with these repeats and are designated Cas (CRISPR-Associated) proteins. This HMM family is found in Ecoli subtype CRISPR/Cas regions of many bacteria, most of which are mesophiles, and not in Archaea. It was designated Cse2 originally, and renamed CasB based on its characterization in the CASCADE complex.
