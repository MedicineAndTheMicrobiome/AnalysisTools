CC  Members of this protein family are found a number of Bacteriodetes lineage bacteria, including both species such as Flavobacterium johnsoniae, which possess a poorly understood form of rapid gliding motility, and other species which apparently do not. Mutation of GldD blocks both this motility and chitin utilization in the model species, Flavobacterium johnsoniae.
