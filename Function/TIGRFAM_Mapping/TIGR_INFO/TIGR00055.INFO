CC  This enzyme builds undecaprenyl diphosphate, a molecule that in bacteria is used a carrier in synthesizing cell wall components.
CC  Alternate name: undecaprenyl pyrophosphate synthetase. Activity has been demonstrated experimentally for members of this family from Micrococcus luteus, E. coli, Haemophilus influenzae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae.
