EN  arsenical resistance protein ArsH
GS  arsH
TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  Members of this protein family occur in arsenate resistance operons that include at least two different types of arsenate reductase.  ArsH is not required for arsenate resistance in some systems. This family belongs to the larger family of NADPH-dependent FMN reductases (Pfam model PF03358). The function of ArsH is not known.
