CC  NrdH-redoxin is a representative of a class of small redox proteins that contain a conserved CXXC motif and are characterized by a glutaredoxin-like amino acid sequence and thioredoxin-like activity profile.  Unlike other the glutaredoxins to which it is most closely related, NrdH aparrently does not interact with glutathione/glutathione reductase, but rather with thioredoxin reductase to catalyze the reduction of ribonucleotide reductase.
