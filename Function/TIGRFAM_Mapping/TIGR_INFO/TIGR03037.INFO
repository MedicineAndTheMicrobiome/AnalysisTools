CC  Members of this protein family, from both bacteria and eukaryotes, are the enzyme 3-hydroxyanthranilate 3,4-dioxygenase. This enzyme acts on the tryptophan metabolite 3-hydroxyanthranilate and produces 2-amino-3-carboxymuconate semialdehyde, which can rearrange spontaneously to quinolinic acid and feed into nicotinamide biosynthesis, or undergo further enzymatic degradation.
