EN  nitrogenase cofactor biosynthesis protein NifB
GS  nifB
TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  This HMM describes NifB, a protein required for the biosynthesis of the iron-molybdenum (or iron-vanadium) cofactor used by the nitrogen-fixing enzyme nitrogenase. NifB belongs to the radical SAM family, and the FeMo cluster biosynthesis process requires S-adenosylmethionine. Archaeal homologs lack the most C-terminal region and score between the trusted and noise cutoffs of this model.
