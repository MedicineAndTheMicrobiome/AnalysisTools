CC  The sequences in this family are members of the PF01048 family of phosphorylases typically acting on nucleotide-sugar substrates.  The genes of  the family modeled here are generally in the same locus with  genes involved in the biosynthesis and elaboration of hopene, the cyclization product of the polyisoprenoid squalene.  This gene is adjacent to the genes PhnA-E and squalene-hopene cyclase (which would be HpnF) in Zymomonas mobilis and their association with hopene biosynthesis  has been noted in the literature [1].   Extending the gene symbol sequence, we suggest the symbol HpnG for the product of this gene.  Hopanoids are known to be components of the plasma membrane and to have polar sugar head groups in Z. mobilis and other species.
