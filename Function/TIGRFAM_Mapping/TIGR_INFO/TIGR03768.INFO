CC  This HMM describes a small collection of probable metallophosphoresterases, related to PF00149. Members of this protein family usually have a Sec-independent TAT (twin-arginine translocation) signal sequence, N-terminal to the region modeled by this HMM. This model and TIGR03767 divide a narrow clade of PF00149-related enzymes.
