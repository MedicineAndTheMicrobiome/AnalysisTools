CC  Nearly every member of this subfamily is NapC, a predicted membrane-anchored four-heme c-type cytochrome that forms one component of the periplasmic nitrate reductase along with NapA, NapB, NapD, NapE, and NapF subunits. A single known exception at this time is NirT, which is instead a component of a nitrite reductase. This family excludes TorC subunits of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) reductases.
