CC  This model describes the P-type ATPase subunit of the complex responsible for translocating potassium ions across biological membranes in microbes.  In E. coli and other species, this complex consists of the proteins KdpA, KdpB, KdpC and KdpF.  KdpB is the ATPase subunit, while KdpA is the potassium-ion translocating subunit[1].  The function of KdpC is unclear, although cit has been suggested to couple the ATPase subunit to the ion-translocating subunit [2], while KdpF serves to stabilize the complex [3].
CC  The potassium P-type ATPases have been characterized as Type IA based on a phylogenetic analysis which places this clade closest to the heavy-metal translocating ATPases (Type IB) [4].  Others place this clade closer to the Na+/K+ antiporter type (Type IIC) based on physical characteristics [1].
CC  This model is very clear-cut, with a strong break between trusted hits and noise.  All members of the seed alignment, from Clostridium, Anabaena and E. coli are in the characterized table.  One sequence above trusted, OMNI|NTL01TA01282, is apparently mis-annotated in the primary literature, but properly annotated by TIGR.
