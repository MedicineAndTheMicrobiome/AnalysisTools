CC  Members of this protein family are uncharacterized radical SAM enzymes that occur in a prokaryotic three-gene system along with homologs of mammalian proteins Memo (Mediator of ErbB2-driven cell MOtility) and AMMERCR1 (Alport syndrome, Mental Retardation, Midface hypoplasia, and Elliptocytosis). Among radical SAM enzymes that have been experimentally characterized, the most closely related in sequence include activases of pyruvate formate-lyase and of benzylsuccinate synthase.
