CC  Members of this protein family, to date, are found in a completed prokaryotic genome if and only if the species is one of the archaeal methanogens. It is a radical SAM enzyme by homology. The exact function is unknown, but likely is linked to methanogenesis. In most genomes, the member of this family is encoded by a gene next to, and divergently transcribed from, the methyl coenzyme M reductase operon.
