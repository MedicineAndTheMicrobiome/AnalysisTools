CC  Members of this family are phosphate butyryltransferase, also called phosphotransbutyrylase. In general, this enzyme is found in butyrate-producing anaerobic bacteria, encoded next to the gene for butyrate kinase. Together, these two enzymes represent what may be the less common of two pathways for butyrate production from butyryl-CoA. The alternative is transfer of the CoA group to acetate by butyryl-CoA:acetate CoA transferase. Cutoffs for this model are set such that the homolog from Thermotoga maritima, whose activity on butyryl-CoA is only 30 % of its activity with acetyl-CoA, scores in the zone between trusted and noice cutoffs.
