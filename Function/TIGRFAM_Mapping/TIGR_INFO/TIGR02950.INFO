CC  This family of RNA polymerase sigma factors is a member of the Sigma-70 subfamily (TIGR02937) and is restricted to certain lineages of the order Bacillales.  This family encompasses at least two distinct sigma factors as two proteins are found in each of B. anthracis, B. subtilis subsp. subtilis str. 168, and B. lichiniformis (although these are not apparently the same two in each).  One of these is designated as SigM in B. subtilis (Swiss_Prot:  	SIGM_BACSU) and is activated by various stressors [1,2].
