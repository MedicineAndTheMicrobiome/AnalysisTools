CC  Members of this protein family are apparent proteases encoded adjacent to the genes for a nickel-type superoxide dismutase. This family belongs to the same larger family (see Pfam model PF00717) as signal peptidase I, an unusual serine protease suggested to have a Ser/Lys catalytic dyad.
DR  PFAM; PF00717; Peptidase S24-like domainRN  [1]
RM  15516600
RT  In vivo production of active nickel superoxide dismutase from Prochlorococcus marinus MIT9313 is dependent on its cognate peptidase.
