CC  This HMM describes a protein family unique to, and greatly expanded in, the Bacteriodetes. Species in this lineage include several, such as Cytophaga hutchinsonii and Flavobacterium johnsoniae, that exhibit a poorly understood rapid gliding phenotype. Several members of this protein family are found in operons with other genes whose loss leads to a loss a this motility.
