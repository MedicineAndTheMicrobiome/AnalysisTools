CC  Members of this protein family are Cys-rich putative bacteriocin precursor peptides found in a few strains of Clostridium and Anaerococcus. This family is related to the family of CLI_3235 (TIGR04065). Members of both families are found next to a CLI_3234 family radical SAM protein that appears to perform post-translational modification.
