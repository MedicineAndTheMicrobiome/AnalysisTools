CC  This family contains one of three readily separable clades of proteins in the group of acetate and propionate--CoA ligases. Characterized members of this family act on propionate. From propionyl-CoA, there is a cyclic degradation pathway: it is ligated by PrpC to the TCA cycle intermediate oxaloacetate, acted upon further by PrpD and an aconitase, then cleaved by PrpB to pyruvate and the TCA cycle intermediate succinate.
