TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  Members of this protein family are radical SAM enzymes responsible for post-translational modifications to the gamma subunit of quinohemoprotein amine dehydrogenases. Ono, et al. (PMID:16546999) suggest that this protein is responsible for intrapeptidyl thioether cross-linking rather than cysteine tryptophylquinone biogenesis in the gamma subunit.
