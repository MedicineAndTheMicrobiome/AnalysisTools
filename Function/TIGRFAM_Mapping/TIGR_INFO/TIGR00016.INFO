CC  Acetate kinase is involved in the activation of acetate to acetyl CoA and in the secretion of acetate. It catalyzes the reaction  ATP + acetate = ADP + acetyl phosphate. Some members of this family have been shown to act on propionate as well as acetate. An example of a propionate/acetate kinase is TdcD of E. coli (SP|P11868), an enzyme of an anaerobic pathway of threonine catabolism. It is not known how many members of this family act on additional substrates besides acetate.
