CC  Members of this family with known function act as trimethyllysine dioxygenase, an enzyme in the pathway for carnitine biosynthesis from lysine. This enzyme is homologous to gamma-butyrobetaine,2-oxoglutarate dioxygenase, which catalyzes the last step in carnitine biosynthesis. Members of this family appear to be eukaryotic only.
