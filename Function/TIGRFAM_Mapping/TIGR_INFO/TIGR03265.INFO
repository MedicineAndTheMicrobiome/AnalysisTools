CC  This ABC transporter ATP-binding protein is found in a number of genomes in operon-like contexts strongly suggesting a substrate specificity for 2-aminoethylphosphonate (2-AEP).  The characterized PhnSTUV system is absent in the genomes in which this system is found. These genomes encode systems for the catabolism of 2-AEP, making the need for a 2-AEP-specific transporter likely.
