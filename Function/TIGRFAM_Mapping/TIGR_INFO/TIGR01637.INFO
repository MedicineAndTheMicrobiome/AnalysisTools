CC  This HMM represents a family of phage proteins, including ArpU, called a putative autolysin regulatory protein. ArpU was described as a regulator of cellular muramidase-2 of Enterococcus hirae but appears to have been cloned from a prophage. This family appears related to the RinA family of bacteriophage transcriptional activators and to some sporulation-specific sigma factors. We propose that this is a phage transcriptional activator family.
