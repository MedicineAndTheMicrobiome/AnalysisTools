CC  This HMM represents plant malate synthase and one of two bacterial forms, designated malate synthase A. The distantly related malate synthase G is described by a separate model. This enzyme and isocitrate lyase are the two characteristic enzymes of the glyoxylate shunt. The shunt enables the cell to use acetyl-CoA to generate increased levels of TCA cycle intermediates for biosynthetic pathways such as gluconeogenesis.
