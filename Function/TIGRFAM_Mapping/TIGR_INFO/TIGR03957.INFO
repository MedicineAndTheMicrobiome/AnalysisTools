CC  Members of this archaeal protein family are HmdB, a partially characterized radical SAM protein with an unusual CX5CX2C motif. Its gene flanks the H2-forming methylene-H4-methanopterin dehydrogenase gene hmdA, found in hydrogenotrophic methanogens. HmdB appears to act in in biosynthesis of the novel cofactor of HmdA.
