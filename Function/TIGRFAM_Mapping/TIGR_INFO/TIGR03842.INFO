TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  This HMM represents a family of putative F420-dependent oxidoreductases, fairly closely related to 5,10-methylenetetrahydromethanopterin reductase (mer, TIGR03555), both within the bacterial luciferase-like monoxygenase (LLM) family. A fairly deep split (to about 40 % sequence identity) in the present family separates a strictly Actinobacterial clade from an alpha/beta/gamma-proteobacterial clade, in which the member is often the only apparent F420-dependent LLM family member. The specific function, and whether Actinobacterial and Proteobacterial clades differ in function, are unknown.
