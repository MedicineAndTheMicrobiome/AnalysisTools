CC  This model represents a domain that is duplicated the aspartate-alanine antiporter AspT, as well as HI0035 of Haemophilus influenzae, YidE and YbjL of E. coli, and a number of other known or putative transporters. Member proteins may have 0, 1, or 2 copies of TrkA potassium uptake domain PF02080 between the duplications. The domain contains several apparent transmembrane regions and is proposed here to act in transport.
