CC  Pullulan is an unusual, industrially important polysaccharide in which short alpha-1,4 chains (maltotriose) are connected in alpha-1,6 linkages. Enzymes that cleave alpha-1,6 linkages in pullulan and release maltotriose are called pullulanases although pullulan itself may not be the natural substrate. This family consists of pullulanases related to the subfamilies described in TIGR02102 and TIGR02103 but having a different domain architecture with shorter sequences. Members are called type I pullulanases.
