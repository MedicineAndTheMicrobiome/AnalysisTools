CC  This uncharacterized, rare protein occurs in the highly variable O-antigen region of some strains of Leptospira, as well as strains of  and serves as a phylogenetic marker for the likely presence of six additional proteins, including an activated sugar-nucleotidyltransferase, an activated sugar epimerase and a dehydratase, an aldolase, and a DegT family aminotransferase. The patterns suggests a role in preparing a novel sugar for O-antigen incorporation.
