CC  CRISPR is a term for Clustered, Regularly Interspaced Short Palidromic Repeats. A number of protein families appear only in association with these repeats and are designated Cas (CRISPR-Associated) proteins. This HMM describes a particularly strongly conserved family found so only in the APERN subtype of CRISPR/Cas loci and represented by AF1879 from Archaeoglobus fulgidus. This family has four perfectly preserved Cys residues. This subfamily is found in a CRISPR/Cas locus we designate APERN, so the family is designated Csa1, for CRISPR/Cas Subtype Protein 1.
