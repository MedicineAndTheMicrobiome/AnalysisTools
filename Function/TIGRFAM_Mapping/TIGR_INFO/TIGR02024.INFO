CC  This HMM represents the tetrahydrofolate (THF) dependent glutamate formiminotransferase involved in the histidine utilization pathway.  This enzyme interconverts L-glutamate and N-formimino-L-glutamate.  The enzyme is bifunctional as it also catalyzes the cyclodeaminase reaction on N-formimino-THF, converting it to 5,10-methenyl-THF and releasing ammonia - part of the process of regenerating THF.
CC  This model covers enzymes from metazoa as well as gram-positive bacteria and archaea.  In humans, deficiency of this enzyme results in a disease phenotype [1].  The crystal structure of the enzyme has been studied in the context of the catalytic mechanism [2].
