CC  CRISPR is a term for Clustered, Regularly Interspaced Short Palidromic Repeats. A number of protein families appear only in association with these repeats and are designated Cas (CRISPR-Associated) proteins.  This HMM represents a minor family of Cas protein found in the (all archaeal) APERN subtype of CRISPR/Cas locus, so the family is designated Csa5, for CRISPR/Cas Subtype Protein 5.
