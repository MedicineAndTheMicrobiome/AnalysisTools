CC  This serine and alanine-rich surface protein repeat, about 175 amino acids long, occurs up to nine times in surface proteins of some Lactobacillus strains, particularly in Lactobacillus rhamnosus. Members proteins have the N-terminal variant signal sequence described by TIGR03715 and C-terminal LPXTG signals for surface attachment by sortase.
