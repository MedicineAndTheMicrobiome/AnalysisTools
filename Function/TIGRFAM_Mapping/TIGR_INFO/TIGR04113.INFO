CC  Members of this protein family are found exclusively in  CRISPR-associated (cas) type I system gene clusters of the Dpsyc subtype. Markers for that type include a variant form of cas3 (model TIGR02621) and the GSU0054-like protein family (model TIGR02165). This family occurs in less than half of known Dpsyc clusters.
