CC  This model describes full-length from some species, and the C-terminal region only from other species, of the YidC/Oxa1 family of proteins. This domain appears to be univeral among bacteria (although absent from Archaea). The well-characterized YidC protein from Escherichia coli and its close homologs contain a large N-terminal periplasmic domain in addition to the region modeled here.
