CC  RsmG was previously called GidB (glucose-inhibited division protein B). It is present and a single copy in nearly all complete eubacterial genomes. It is missing only from some obligate intracellular species of various lineages (Chlamydiae, Ehrlichia, Wolbachia, Anaplasma, Buchnera, etc.). RsmG shows a methytransferase fold in its the crystal structure, and acts as a 7-methylguanosine (m(7)G) methyltransferase, apparently specific to 16S rRNA.
