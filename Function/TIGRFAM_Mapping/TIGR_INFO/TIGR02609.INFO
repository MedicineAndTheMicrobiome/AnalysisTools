CC  Members of this protein family are putative addiction module antidote proteins that appear recurringly in two-gene operons with members of the Doc (death-on-curing) family TIGR01550. Members of this family contain a SpoVT/AbrB-like domain (PF04014). Note that the gene pairs with a member of this family tend to be found on bacterial chromosomes, not on plasmids.
