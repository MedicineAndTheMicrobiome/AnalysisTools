TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  This protein consists of an N-terminal possible metal-binding domain (PF04068) followed by a 4Fe-4S cluster binding domain (PF00037) followed by a C-terminal ABC transporter, ATP-binding domain (PF00005).  This combination of N-terminal domains is observed in the RNase L inhibitor, RLI [1].
CC  This model has the same scope as an archaeal COG (arCOG00187) [2] and is found in all completely sequenced archaea and does not recognize any known non-archaeal genes.
