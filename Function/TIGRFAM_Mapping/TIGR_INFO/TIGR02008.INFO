CC  This model represents single domain 2Fe-2S (also called plant type) ferredoxins. In general, these occur as a single domain proteins or with a chloroplast transit peptide. Species tend to be photosynthetic, but several forms may occur in one species and individually may not be associated with photocynthesis. Halobacterial forms differ somewhat in architecture; they score between trusted and noise cutoffs. Sequences scoring below the noise cutoff tend to be ferredoxin-related domains of larger proteins.
