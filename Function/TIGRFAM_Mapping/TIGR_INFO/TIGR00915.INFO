TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  Proteins scoring above the trusted cutoff (1000) form a tight clade within the RND (Resistance-Nodulation-Cell Division) superfamily. Proteins scoring greater than the noise cutoff (100) appear to form a larger clade, cleanly separated from more distant homologs that include cadmium/zinc/cobalt resistance transporters.
CC  This family is one of several subfamilies within the scope of Pfam HMM PF00873.
