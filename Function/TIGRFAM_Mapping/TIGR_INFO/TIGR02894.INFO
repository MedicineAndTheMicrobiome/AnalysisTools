CC  In a subset of endospore-forming members of the Firmcutes, members of this protein family are found, several to a genome. Two very strongly conserved sequences regions are separated by a highly variable linker region. Much of the linker region was excised from the seed alignment for this model. A characterized member is the prespore-specific transcription RsfA from Bacillus subtilis, previously called YwfN, which is controlled by sigma factor F and seems to fine-tune expression of some genes in the sigma-F regulon. A paralog in Bacillus subtilis is designated YlbO.
