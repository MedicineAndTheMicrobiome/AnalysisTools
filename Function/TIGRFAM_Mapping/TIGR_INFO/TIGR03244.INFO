CC  In many bacteria, the arginine succinyltransferase (ast) pathway operon consists of five genes, including this protein, arginine N-succinyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.109). In a few species, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the member of this family is encoded adjacent to a paralog, and the two polypeptides form a heterodimeric enzyme, active on both arginine and ornithine. In such species, this polypeptide may be treated as the beta subunit of an enzyme that may be named either arginine N-succinyltransferase (AST) or arginine and orthithine N-succinyltransferase (AOST).
