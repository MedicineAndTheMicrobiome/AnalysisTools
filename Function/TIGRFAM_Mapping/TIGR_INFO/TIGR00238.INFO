CC  This HMM represents essentially the whole of E. coli YjeK and of some of its apparent orthologs. YodO in Bacillus subtilis, a family member which is longer protein by an additional 100 residues, is characterized as a lysine 2,3-aminomutase with iron, sulphide and pyridoxal 5'-phosphate groups. The homolog MJ0634 from M. jannaschii is preceded by nearly 200 C-terminal residues. This family shows similarity to molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis protein MoaA and related proteins.
CC  Note that the E. coli homolog was expressed in E. coli and purified and found not to display display lysine 2,3-aminomutase activity. Active site residues are found in 100 residue extension in B. subtilis. Name changed to KamA family protein.
