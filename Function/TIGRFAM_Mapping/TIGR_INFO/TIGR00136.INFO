CC  GidA, the longer of two forms of GidA-related proteins, appears to be present in all complete eubacterial genomes so far, as well as Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A subset of these organisms have a closely related protein. GidA is absent in the Archaea. It appears to act with MnmE, in an alpha2/beta2 heterotetramer, in the 5-carboxymethylaminomethyl modification of uridine 34 in certain tRNAs. The shorter, related protein, previously called gid or gidA(S), is now called TrmFO (see model TIGR00137).
