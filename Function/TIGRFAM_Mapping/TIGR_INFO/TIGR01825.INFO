CC  This HMM represents an enzyme subfamily related to three known enzymes; it appears closest to glycine C-acteyltransferase, shows no overlap with it in species distribution, and may share that function. The three closely related enzymes are glycine C-acetyltransferase (2-amino-3-ketobutyrate coenzyme A ligase), 5-aminolevulinic acid synthase, and 8-amino-7-oxononanoate synthase. All transfer the R-group (acetyl, succinyl, or 6-carboxyhexanoyl) from coenzyme A to an amino acid (Gly, Gly, Ala, respectively), with release of CO2 for the latter two reactions.
