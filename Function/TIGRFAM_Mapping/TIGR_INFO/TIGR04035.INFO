CC  This model describes a region of about 63 amino acids that is composed of three repeats of a more broadly distributed family of shorter repeats modeled by Pfam model PF01473. While the shorter repeats are often associated with choline binding (and therefore with cell wall binding), the longer repeat described here represents a subgroup of repeat sequences associated with glucan binding, as found in a number glycosylhydrolases. Shah, et al. describe a repeat consensus, WYYFDANGKAVTGAQTINGQTLYFDQDGKQVKG, that corresponds to half of the repeat as modeled here and one and a half copies of the repeat as modeled by PF01473.
