CC  This family includes a number of 2-aminoethylphosphonate aminotransferases, some of which are indicated to operate in the catabolism of 2-aminoethylphosphonate (AEP) and others which are involved in the biosynthesis of the same compound.  The catabolic enzyme (PhnW, [1]) is known to use pyruvate:alanine as the transfer partner and is modeled by the equivalog-level HMM (TIGR02326).  The PhnW family is apparently a branch of a larger tree including genes (AepZ) adjacent to others responsible for the biosynthesis of phosphonoacetaldehyde [2].  The identity of the transfer partner  is unknown for these enzymes and considering the reversed flux compared to PhnW, it may very well be different.
