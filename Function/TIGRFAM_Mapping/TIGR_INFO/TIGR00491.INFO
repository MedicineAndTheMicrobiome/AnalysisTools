CC  This HMM describes archaeal and eukaryotic orthologs of bacterial IF-2. Like IF-2, it helps convey the initiator tRNA to the ribosome, although the initiator is N-formyl-Met in bacteria and Met here. This protein is not closely related to the subunits of eIF-2 of eukaryotes, which is also involved in the initiation of translation. The aIF-2 of Methanococcus jannaschii contains a large intein interrupting a region of very strongly conserved sequence very near the amino end; the alignment generated by this HMM does not correctly align the sequences from Methanococcus jannaschii and Pyrococcus horikoshii in this region.
