CC  CRISPR is a term for Clustered, Regularly Interspaced Short Palidromic Repeats. A number of protein families appear only in association with these repeats and are designated Cas (CRISPR-Associated) proteins.  This family is part of the ECOLI subtype CRISPR/Cas locus, and now characterized as part of the CASCADE complex of that system. It shares a small N-terminal homology region with members of several other CRISPR/Cas subtypes, and we view the families that share this region as being Cas5.
