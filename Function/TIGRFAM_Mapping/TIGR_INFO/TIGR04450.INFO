CC  This model describes full-length proteins of Gram-positive bacteria that consist of an N-terminal signal peptide, a central region of unknown function, and a Cys-rich C-terminal region. In both the overall architecture and the apparent weak homology of the C-terminal region itself, these proteins resemble archaeal proteins such as the halocin C8 precursor. In that precursor, the C-terminal region is a bacteriocin but the N-terminal region functions as the immunity protein. The related family of halocin C8-like bacteriocins and their bacterial homologs are recognized by model TIGR04449.
