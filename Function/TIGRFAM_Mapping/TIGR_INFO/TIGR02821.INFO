CC  This model describes a protein family from bacteria, yeast, and human, with a conserved critical role in formaldehyde detoxification as S-formylglutathione hydrolase (EC 3.1.2.12). Members in eukaryotes such as the human protein are better known as esterase D (EC 3.1.1.1), an enzyme with broad specificity, although S-formylglutathione hydrolase has now been demonstrated as well.
