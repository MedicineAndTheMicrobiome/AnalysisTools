CC  This group of sequences contains annotations for both acetylornithine deacetylase and succinyl-diaminopimelate desuccinylase, but does not contain any members with experimental characterization.  Bacillus, Staphylococcus and Sulfolobus species contain multiple hits to this subfamily and each may have a separate activity.  Determining which is which must await further laboratory research.
