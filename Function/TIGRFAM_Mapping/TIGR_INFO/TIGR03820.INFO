CC  This model describes lysine-2,3-aminomutase as found along with beta-lysine acetyltransferase in a two-enzyme pathway for making the compatible solute N-epsilon-acetyl-beta-lysine. This compatible solute, or osmolyte, is known to protect a number of methanogenic archaea against salt stress. The trusted cutoff distinguishes a tight clade with essentially full-length homology from additional homologs that are shorter or highly diverged in the C-terminal region. All members of this family have the radical SAM motif CXXXCXXC, while some but not all have a second copy of the motif in the C-terminal region.

RT  Lysine-2,3-aminomutase and beta-lysine acetyltransferase genes of methanogenic archaea are salt induced and are essential for the biosynthesis of Nepsilon-acetyl-beta-lysine and growth at high salinity.
