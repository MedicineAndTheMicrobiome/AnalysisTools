CC  This HMM describes the eukaryotic 60S (cytosolic) ribosomal protein L7 and paralogs that may or may not also be L7. Human, Drosophila, and Arabidopsis all have both a typical L7 and an L7-related paralog. This family is designated subfamily rather than equivalog to reflect these uncharacterized paralogs.
CC  Members of this family average ~ 250 residues in length, somewhat longer than the archaeal L30P/L7E homolog (~ 155 residues) and much longer than the related bacterial/organellar form (~ 60 residues).
