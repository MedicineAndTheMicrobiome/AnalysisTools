CC  Malonate decarboxylase can be a soluble enzyme, or a sodium ion-translocating with additional membrane-bound components. Members of this protein family are integral membrane proteins required to couple decarboxylation to sodium ion export. This family belongs to a broader family, TIGR01109 of sodium ion-translocating decarboxylase beta subunits.
