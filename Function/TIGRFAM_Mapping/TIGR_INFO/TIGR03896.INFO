CC  Members of this protein family are uncharacterized and contain two copies of the cyclic nucleotide-binding domain PF00027. Members are restricted to select cyanobacteria but are found regularly in association with a transport operon that, in turn, is associated with the production of putative bacteriocins. The models describing the transport operon are TIGR03794, TIGR03796, and TIGR03797.
