CC  This protein is designated Asp1 because, along with SecY2, SecA2, and other proteins it is part of the accessory secretory protein system. The system is involved in the export of serine-rich glycoproteins important for virulence in a number of Gram-positive species, including Streptococcus gordonii and Staphylococcus aureus. This protein family is assigned to transport rather than glycosylation function, but the specific molecular role is unknown.
