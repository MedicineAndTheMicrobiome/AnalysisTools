CC  This HMM recognizes a region of about 55 amino acids toward the N-terminal end of bacterial proteins of about 85 amino acids in length. The best-characterized member is prevent-host-death (phd) of bacteriophage P1, the antidote partner of death-on-curing (doc) (TIGR01550) in an addiction module. Addiction modules prevent plasmid curing by killing the host cell as the longer-lived killing protein persists while the gene for the shorter-lived antidote is lost. Note, however, that relatively few members of this family appear to be plasmid or phage-encoded. Also, there is little overlap, except for phage P1 itself, of species with this family and with the doc family.
