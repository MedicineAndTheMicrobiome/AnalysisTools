CC  This HMM represents a family of pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enzymes closely related to (and often designated as putative examples of) 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase. It appears that members of this family include both D-cysteine desulfhydrase (EC 4.4.1.15) and  1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase (EC 3.5.99.7).
