CC  Members of this protein family are polyribonucleotide nucleotidyltransferase, also called polynucleotide phosphorylase. Some members have been shown also to have additional functions as guanosine pentaphosphate synthetase and as poly(A) polymerase (see model TIGR02696 for an exception clade, within this family).
