CC  This group of proteins contains an AMP-binding domain (PF00501) associated with acyl CoA-ligases.  These proteins are generally found in genomes containing the exosortase/PEP-CTERM protein expoert system [1], specifically the type 1 variant of this system described by the Genome Property GenProp0652.  When found in this context they are invariably present next to a decarboxylase enzyme.  A number of sequences from Burkholderia species also hit this model, but the genomic context is obviously different.  The hypothesis of a constant substrate for this family is only strong where the exosortase context is present.
