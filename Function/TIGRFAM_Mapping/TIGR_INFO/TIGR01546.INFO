CC  This HMM describes the type II glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenases which are limited to archaea.  These enzymes catalyze the interconversion of 1,3-diphosphoglycerate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, a central step in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis.  In archaea, either NAD or NADP may be utilized as the cofactor.
CC  The class I GAPDH's from bacteria and eukaryotes are covered by TIGR01534.
CC  All of the members of the seed are characterized.  See, for instance [1].  This model is very solid, there are no species falling between trusted and noise at this time.  The closest relatives scoring in the noise are the class I GAPDH's.
