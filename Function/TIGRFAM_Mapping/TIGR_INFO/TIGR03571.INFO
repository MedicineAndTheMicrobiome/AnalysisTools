CC  This family is a distinct subgroup among members of the luciferase monooxygenase domain family. The larger family contains both FMN-binding enzymes (luciferase, alkane monooxygenase) and F420-binding enzymes (methylenetetrahydromethanopterin reductase, secondary alcohol dehydrogenase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase). Although some members of the domain family bind coenzyme F420 rather than FMN, members of this family are from species that lack the genes for F420 biosynthesis. A crystal structure, but not function, is known (but unpublished) for the member from Bacillus cereus, PDB|2B81.
