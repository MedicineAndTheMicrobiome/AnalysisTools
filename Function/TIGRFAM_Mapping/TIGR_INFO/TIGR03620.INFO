CC  Members of this protein family, related to F420-dependent oxidoreductases within the larger family of a bacterial luciferase (an FMN-dependent enzyme), occurs only within the small subset of species that synthesize F420. Most such proteins are from members of the Actinobacteria, but at least one species, Sphingomonas wittichii, belongs to the Alphaproteobacteria.
