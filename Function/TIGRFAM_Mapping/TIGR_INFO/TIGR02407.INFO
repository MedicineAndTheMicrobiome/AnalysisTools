CC  Members of this family of class III pyridoxal-phosphate-dependent aminotransferases are diaminobutyrate--2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.76) that catalyze the first step in ectoine biosynthesis from L-aspartate beta-semialdehyde. This family is readily separated phylogenetically from enzymes with the same substrate and product but involved in other process such as siderophore (SP|Q9Z3R2) or 1,3-diaminopropane (SP|P44951) biosynthesis. The family TIGR00709 previously included both groups but has now been revised to exclude the ectoine biosynthesis proteins of this family. Ectoine is a compatible solute particularly effective in conferring salt tolerance.
