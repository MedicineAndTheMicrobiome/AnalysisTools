CC  In both E. coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, this protein is responsible for the dimethylation of two adjacent adenosine residues in a conserved hairpin of 16S rRNA in bacteria, 18S rRNA in eukaryotes. This adjacent dimethylation is the only rRNA modification shared by bacteria and eukaryotes. A single member of this family is present in each of the first 20 completed microbial genomes.
CC  This protein is essential in yeast, but not in E. coli, where its deletion leads to resistance to the antibiotic kasugamycin. Alternate name: S-adenosylmethionine--6-N',N'-adenosyl (rRNA) dimethyltransferase
