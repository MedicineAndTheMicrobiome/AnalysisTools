EC  2.1.1.-

CC  This enzyme is responsible for two methylations of a characteristic guanine of most tRNA molecules. The activity has been demonstrated for eukaryotic and archaeal proteins, which are active when expressed in E. coli, a species that lacks this enzyme. At least one Eubacterium, Aquifex aeolicus, has an ortholog, as do all completed archaeal genomes.
