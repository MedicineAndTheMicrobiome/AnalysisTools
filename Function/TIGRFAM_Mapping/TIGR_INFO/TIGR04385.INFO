CC  Members of this protein family are one of two tandem B12-binding domain/radical SAM domain proteins that occur in a genome context with a pair of homologs to ThiC (phosphomethylpyrimidine synthase, EC 4.1.99.17), an enzyme that performs a complex rearrangement involved in thiamin biosynthesis, and a putative CobT (nicotinate-nucleotide--dimethylbenzimidazole phosphoribosyltransferase), an enzyme of cobalamin biosynthesis.
