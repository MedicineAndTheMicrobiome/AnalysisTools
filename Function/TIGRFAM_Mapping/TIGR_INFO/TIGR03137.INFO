CC  This peroxiredoxin (AhpC, alkylhydroperoxide reductase subunit C) is one subunit of a two-subunit complex with subunit F(TIGR03140).  Usually these are found as an apparent operon.  The gene has been characterized in Bacteroides fragilis [1] where it is important in oxidative stress defense.
CC  This gene contains two invariant cysteine residues, one near the N-terminus and one near the C-terminus, each followed immediately by a proline residue.
