CC  Members of this family are the m6-adenine DNA methyltransferase protein, or domain of a fusion protein that also carries m5 cytosine methyltransferase activity, of type II restriction systems of the Alw26I/Eco31I/Esp3I family. A methyltransferase of this family is alway accompanied by a  type II restriction endonuclease from the Alw26I/Eco31I/Esp3I family (TIGR02986) and by an adenine-specific modification methyltransferase. Members of this family are unusual in that regions of similarity to homologs outside this family are circularly permuted.
