CC  This family previously was designated pyruvate formate-lyase, but it now appears that members include the B12-independent glycerol dehydratase. Therefore, the functional definition of the family is being broadened.
CC  This family includes the PflF and PflD proteins of E. coli, described as isoforms of pyruvate-formate lyase found in a limited number additional species.  PFL catalyzes the reaction pyruvate + CoA -> acetyl-CoA + formate, which is a step in the fermentation of glucose.
