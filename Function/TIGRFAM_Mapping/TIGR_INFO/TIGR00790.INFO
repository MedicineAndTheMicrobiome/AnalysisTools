CC  The Formate-Nitrite Transporter (FNT) Family (TC 2.A.44)
CC  The prokaryotic proteins of the FNT family probably function in the transport of the structurally related compounds, formate and nitrite. The homologous yeast protein may function as a short chain aliphatic carboxylate H+ symporter,
CC  transporting formate, acetate and propionate, and functioning primarily as an acetate uptake permease. The putative formate efflux transporters (FocA) of bacteria associated with pyruvate-formate lyase (pfl) comprise cluster I; the putative formate uptake permeases (FdhC) of bacteria and archaea associated with formate dehydrogenase comprise cluster II; the putative nitrite uptake permeases (NirC) of bacteria comprise cluster III, and the single yeast protein, the putative acetate:H+ symporter alone comprises cluster IV. The energy coupling mechanisms for proteins of the FNT family have not been extensively characterized. HCO2 -, CH3CO2 - and NO2 - uptakes are probably coupled to H+
CC  symport. HCO2 - efflux may be driven by the membrane potential by a uniport mechanism or by H+ antiport.
