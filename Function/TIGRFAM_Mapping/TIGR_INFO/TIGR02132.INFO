CC  This HMM describes a protein, PhaR, localized to polyhydroxyalkanoic acid (PHA) inclusion granules in Bacillus cereus and related species. PhaR is required for PHA biosynthesis along with PhaC and may be a regulatory subunit.
RM  11418564
RT  PhaC and PhaR are required for polyhydroxyalkanoic acid synthase activity in Bacillus megaterium.
