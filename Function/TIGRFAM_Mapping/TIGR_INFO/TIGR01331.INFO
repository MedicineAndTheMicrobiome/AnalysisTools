CC  Sulfate is incorporated into 3-phosphoadenylylsulfate, PAPS, for utilization in pathways such as methionine biosynthesis. Transfer of sulfate from PAPS to an acceptor leaves adenosine 3'-5'-bisphosphate, APS. This HMM describes a form found in bacteria of the enzyme 3'(2'),5'-bisphosphate nucleotidase, which removes the 3'-phosphate from APS to regenerate AMP and help drive the cycle.
