CC  Proteins in this subfamily appear to be associated with the process of FeS-cluster assembly.  The HesB proteins are associated with the nif gene cluster and the Rhizobium gene IscN has been shown to be required for nitrogen fixation [1].  Nitrogenase includes multiple FeS clusters and many genes for their assembly.  The E. coli SufA protein is associated with SufS, a NifS homolog and SufD which are involved in the FeS cluster assembly of the FhnF protein [2].  The Azotobacter protein IscA (homologs of which are also found in E.coli) is associated which IscS, another NifS homolog and IscU, a nifU homolog as well as other factors consistent with a role in FeS cluster chemistry [3].  A homolog from Geobacter contains a selenocysteine in place of an otherwise invariant cysteine, further suggesting a role in redox chemistry.
