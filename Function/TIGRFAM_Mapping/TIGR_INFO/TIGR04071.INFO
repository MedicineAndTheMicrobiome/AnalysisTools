CC  Methanobactins are siderophore-like copper-chelating natural products with considerable variety from species to species. The 11-residue methanobactin of Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b is derived from a 30-residue precursor. A very similar 31-residue precursor is found in the rice endophyte Azospirillum sp. B510, which has not yet been shown to produce a methanobactin. This HMM models the shared region of the first 25 amino acids, including a Cys-Gly-Ser motif.

RT  A comparison of methanobactins from Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b and Methylocystis strain Sb2 predicts methanobactins are synthesized from diverse peptide precursors modified to create a common core for binding and reducing copper ions.
