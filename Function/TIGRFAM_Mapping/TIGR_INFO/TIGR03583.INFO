CC  Members of this family of relatively uncommon proteins are found in both Gram-positive (e.g. Enterococcus faecalis) and Gram-negative (e.g. Aeromonas hydrophila) bacteria, as part of a cluster of conserved proteins. These proteins resemble aminohydrolases (see PF01979), including dihydroorotases. The function is unknown.
