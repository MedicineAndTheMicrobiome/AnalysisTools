CC  Members of this protein family are Lep, an outer membrane lipoprotein LipL41-binding protein that appears to function as a chaperone important to its expression. LipL41 is the third most abundant lipoprotein in the pathogen Leptospira interrogans, but is found in saprophytic Leptospira species as well and is not essential for virulence.
