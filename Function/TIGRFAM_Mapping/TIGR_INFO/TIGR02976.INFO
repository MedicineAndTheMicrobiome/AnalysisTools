CC  This model describes the PspB protein of the psp (phage shock protein) operon, as found in Escherichia coli and many related species. Expression of a phage protein called secretin protein IV, and a number of other stresses including ethanol, heat shock, and defects in protein secretion trigger sigma-54-dependent expression of the phage shock regulon. PspB is both a regulator and an effector protein of the phage shock response.
