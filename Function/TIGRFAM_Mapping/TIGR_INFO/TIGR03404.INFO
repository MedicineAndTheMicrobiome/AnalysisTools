CC  Members of this protein family are defined as bicupins as they  have two copies of the cupin domain (PF00190). Two different known activities for members of this family are oxalate decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.2) and oxalate oxidase (EC 1.2.3.4), although the latter activity has more often been found in distantly related monocupin (germin) proteins.
