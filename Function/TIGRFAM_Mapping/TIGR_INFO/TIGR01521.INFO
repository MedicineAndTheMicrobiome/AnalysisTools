CC  Members of this family are class II examples of the enzyme fructose-bisphosphate aldolase, an enzyme both of glycolysis and (in the opposite direction) of the Calvin cycle of CO2 fixation. A deep split separates the tightly conserved yeast/E. coli/Mycobacterium subtype (all species lacking the Calvin cycle) represented by model TIGR01520 from a broader group of aldolases that includes both tagatose- and fructose-bisphosphate aldolases. This model represents a distinct, elongated, very well conserved subtype within the latter group. Most species with this aldolase subtype have the Calvin cycle.
