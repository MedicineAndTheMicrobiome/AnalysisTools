CC  This protein is required for normal nodulation by nitrogen-fixing root nodule bacteria such as Mesorhizobium loti. It is a member of the family of ABC transporter ATP binding proteins and works with NodJ to export a nodulation signal molecule.
CC  This model does not recognize the highly divergent NodI from Azorhizobium caulinodans.
