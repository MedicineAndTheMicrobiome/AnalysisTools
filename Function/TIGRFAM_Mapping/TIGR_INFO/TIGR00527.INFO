CC  This model represents the glycine cleavage system H protein, which shuttles the methylamine group of glycine from the P protein to the T protein. The mature protein is about 130 residues long and contains a lipoyl group covalently bound to a conserved Lys residue.
CC  The genome of Aquifex aeolicus contains one protein scoring above the trusted cutoff and clustering with other bacterial H proteins, and four more proteins clustering together and scoring below the trusted cutoff; it seems doubtful that all of these homologs are authentic H protein. The Chlamydial homolog of H protein is nearly as divergent as the Aquifex outgroup, is not accompanied by P and T proteins, is not included in the seed alignment, and consequently also scores below the trusted cutoff.
