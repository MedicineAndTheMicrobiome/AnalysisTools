CC  Members of this family are alkylhydroperoxidases, which catalyze the reduction of peroxides to their corresponding alcohols via oxidation of cysteine residues. In these alkylhydroperoxidases, the cysteines are located in a conserved -CXXC- motif located towards the COOH terminus.  In Mycobacterium tuberculosis, two non-homologous alkylhydroperoxidases, AhpD and AhpC, are found in the same operon.
