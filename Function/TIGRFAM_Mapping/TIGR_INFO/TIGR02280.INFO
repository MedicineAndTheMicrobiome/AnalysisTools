CC  This family of proteins are found within apparent operons for the degradation of phenylacetic acid [1].  These proteins contain the enoyl-CoA hydratase domain as detected by PF00378.  This activity is consistent with current hypotheses for the degradation pathway [2] which involve the ligation of phenylacetate with coenzyme A (paaF), hydroxylation (paaGHIJK), ring-opening (paaN) and degradation of the resulting fatty acid-like compound to a Krebs cycle intermediate (paaABCDE).
