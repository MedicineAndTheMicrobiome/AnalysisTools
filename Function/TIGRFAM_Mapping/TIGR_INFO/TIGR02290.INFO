CC  The M3 family of metallopeptidases contains several distinct clades. Oligoendopeptidase F as characterized in Lactococcus, the functionally equivalent oligoendopeptidase B of group B Streptococcus, and closely related sequences are described by TIGR00181. The present family is quite similar but forms a distinct clade, and a number of species have one member of each. A greater sequence difference separates members of TIGR02289, probable oligoendopeptidases of the M3 family that probably should not be designated PepF.
