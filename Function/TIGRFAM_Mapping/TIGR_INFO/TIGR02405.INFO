CC  This family consists of repressors of the LacI family typically associated with trehalose utilization operons. Trehalose is imported as trehalose-6-phosphate and then hydrolyzed by alpha,alpha-phosphotrehalase to glucose and glucose-6-P. This family includes repressors mostly from Gammaproteobacteria and does not include the GntR family TreR of Bacillus subtilis
