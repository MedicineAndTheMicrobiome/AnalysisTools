CC  Members of this protein family are the DotB component of Dot/Icm secretion systems, as found in obligate intracellular pathogens Legionella pneumophila and Coxiella burnetii. While this system resembles type IV secretion systems and has been called a form of type IV, the liturature now seems to favor calling this the Dot/Icm system. This family is most closely related to TraJ proteins of plasmid transfer, rather than to proteins of other type IV secretion systems.
