CC  This HMM describes LpxA, an enzyme for the biosynthesis of lipid A, a component oflipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the outer membrane outer leaflet of most Gram-negative bacteria. Some differences are found between lipid A of different species, but this protein represents the first step (from UDP-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine) and appears to be conserved in function. Proteins from this family contain many copies of the bacterial transferase hexapeptide repeat (PF00132).
