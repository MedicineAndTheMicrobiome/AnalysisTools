CC  Members of this protein family are penicillin-binding protein 2 (PBP-2), a protein whose gene (designated pbpA or mrdA) generally is found next to the gene for RodA, a protein required for rod (bacillus) shape in many bacteria. PBP-2 acts as a transpeptidase for cell elongation (hence, rod-shape).

RT  Nucleotide sequence of the rodA gene, responsible for the rod shape of Escherichia coli: rodA and the pbpA gene, encoding penicillin-binding protein 2, constitute the rodA operon.
