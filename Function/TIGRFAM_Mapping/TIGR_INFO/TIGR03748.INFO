EN  conjugative transfer region protein, TIGR03748 family
TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  This HMM describes the conserved N-terminal region of a variable length protein family associated with laterally transfered regions flanked by markers of conjugative plasmid integration and/or transposition. Most members of the family have the lipoprotein signal peptide motif. A member of the family from a pathogenicity island in Salmonella enterica serovar Dublin strain was designated PilL for nomenclature consistency with a neighboring gene for the pilin structural protein PilS. However, the species distribution of this protein family tracks much better with markers of conjugal transfer than with markers of PilS-like pilin structure.
