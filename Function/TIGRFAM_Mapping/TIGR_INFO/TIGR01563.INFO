TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  This family describes a small protein of about 100 amino acids found in bacteriophage and in bacterial prophage regions. Examples include gp9 of phage HK022 and gp16 of phage SPP1. This minor structural protein is suggested to be a head-tail adaptor protein (although the source of this annotation was not traced during construction of this model).
