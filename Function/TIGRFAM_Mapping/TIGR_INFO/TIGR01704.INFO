CC  This model represents the enzyme 5-methylthioadenosine/S-adenosylhomocysteine nucleosidase which acts on its two substrates at the same active site.  This enzyme is involved in the recycling of the components of S-adenosylmethionine after it has donated one of its two non-ribose sulfur ligands to an acceptor.  In the case of 5-methylthioadenosine this represents the first step of the methionine salvage pathway in bacteria [1,2,3].  This enzyme is widely distributed in bacteria, especially those that lack adenosylhomocysteinase (EC 3.3.1.1).
CC  One clade of bacteria including Agrobacterium, Mesorhizobium, Sinorhizobium and Brucella includes sequences annotated as MTA/SAH nucleotidase, but differs significantly in homology and has no independent experimental evidence.
CC  There are homologs of this enzyme in plants, some of which score between trusted and noise cutoffs here, but there is no experimental evidence to validate this function at this time.
