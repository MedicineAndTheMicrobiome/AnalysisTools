CC  Members of this protein family belong to the same domain family as the mammalian protein Memo (Mediator of ErbB2-driven cell MOtility). Members of the present family occur as part of a three gene system with an uncharacterized radical SAM enzyme and a homolog of the mammalian protein AMMECR1, a mammalian protein named for AMME - Alport syndrome, Mental Retardation, Midface hypoplasia, and Elliptocytosis. Memo in humans has protein-protein interaction activity with binding of phosphorylated Try, but members of this family may be active as enzymes, as suggested by homology to a class of nonheme iron dioxygenases.

RT  Memo is homologous to nonheme iron dioxygenases and binds an ErbB2-derived phosphopeptide in its vestigial active site.
