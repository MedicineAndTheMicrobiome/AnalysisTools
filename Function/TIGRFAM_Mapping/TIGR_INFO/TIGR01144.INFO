CC  This model describes the F1/F0 ATP synthase b subunit in bacteria only. Scoring just below the trusted cutoff are the N-terminal domains of Mycobacterial b/delta fusion proteins and a subunit from an archaeon, Methanosarcina barkeri, in which the ATP synthase homolog differs in architecture and is not experimentally confirmed. This model helps resolve b from the related b' subunit. Within the family is an example from a sodium-translocating rather than proton-translocating ATP synthase.
