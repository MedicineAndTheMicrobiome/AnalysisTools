CC  This HMM describes a family of redox proteins related to the succinate dehydrogenases and fumarate reductases of E. coli, mitochondria, and other well-characterized systems. A member of this family from Shewanella frigidimarina NCIMB400 is characterized as a water-soluble periplasmic protein with four heme groups, a non-covalently bound FAD, and essentially unidirectional fumarate reductase activity. At least seven distinct members of this family are found in Shewanella oneidensis, a species able to use a wide variety of pathways for respiraton.
