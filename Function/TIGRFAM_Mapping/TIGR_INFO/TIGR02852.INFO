CC  Members of this family represent the B subunit of dipicolinic acid synthetase, an enzyme that synthesizes a small molecule that appears to confer heat stability to bacterial endospores such as those of Bacillus subtilis. The A and B subunits are together in what was originally designated the spoVF locus for stage V of endospore formation.
