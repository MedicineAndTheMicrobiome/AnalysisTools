CC  CRISPR is a term for Clustered, Regularly Interspaced Short Palidromic Repeats. A number of protein families appear only in association with these repeats and are designated Cas (CRISPR-Associated) proteins.  This HMM represents the region of stongest conservation, the N-terminal half, of one such family, represented by TM1795 from Thermotoga maritima. This protein is the first of a set of six genes, mostly from the RAMP superfamily, that we designated the CRISPR-associated RAMP module.
