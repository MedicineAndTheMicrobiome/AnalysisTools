CC  This HMM represents a family of archaeal proteins found in a single copy per genome. It contains two KH domains (PF00013) and is most closely related to the central region bacterial NusA, a transcription termination factor named for its iteraction with phage lambda protein N in E. coli. The proteins required for antitermination by N include NusA, NusB, nusE (ribosomal protein S10), and nusG. This system, on the whole, appears not to be present in the Archaea.
