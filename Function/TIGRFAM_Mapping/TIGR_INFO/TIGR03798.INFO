CC  This model describes a conserved, fairly long (about 65 residue) leader peptide region for a family of putative ribosomal natural products (RNP) of small size. Members of the seed alignment (most sequences scoring better than 54 bits to the HMMER 2 model) tend to have the Gly-Gly motif as the last two residues of the matched region. This is a cleavage site for a combination processing/export ABC transporter with a peptidase domain. Members include the prochlorosins, lantipeptides from Prochlorococcus.
