CC  CRISPR is a term for Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palidromic Repeats. A number of protein families appear only in association with these repeats and are designated Cas (CRISPR associated) proteins.  This HMM represents one such family, typified by MJ0381 of Methanococcus jannaschii. This archaeal clade is a member of the DevR family (TIGR01875) which includes the DevR protein of Myxococcus xanthus, a protein whose expression appears to regulated through a number of means, including both location and autorepression; DevR mutants are incapable of fruiting body development [1]. This subfamily is found in a CRISPR/Cas locus we designate APERN, so the family is designated Csa2, for CRISPR/Cas Subtype Protein 2.
