CC  The protein family includes an uncharacterized member designated phnA in Escherichia coli, part of a large operon associated with alkylphosphonate uptake and carbon-phosphorus bond cleavage. This protein is not related to the characterized phosphonoacetate hydrolase designated PhnA by Kulakova, et al. (2001, 1997).
