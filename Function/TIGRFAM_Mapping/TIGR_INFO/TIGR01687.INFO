CC  Members of this family appear to be archaeal versions of MoaD, subunit 1 of molybdopterin converting factor. This model has been split from the bacterial/eukaryotic equivalog model TIGR01682 because the presence of two members of this family in a substantial number of archaeal species suggests that roles might not be interchangeable.
