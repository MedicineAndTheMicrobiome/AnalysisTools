CC  This HMM represents the signal peptide peptidase A (SppA, protease IV) as found in E. coli, Treponema pallidum, Mycobacterium leprae, and several other species, in which it has a molecular mass around 67 kDa and a duplication such that the N-terminal half shares extensive homology with the C-terminal half. This enzyme was shown in E. coli to form homotetramers.
CC  E. coli SohB, which is most closely homologous to the C-terminal duplication of SppA, is predicted to perform a similar function of small peptide degradation, but in the periplasm. Many prokaryotes have a single SppA/SohB homolog that may perform the function of either or both.
