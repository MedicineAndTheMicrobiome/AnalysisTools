CC  The Organellar Chloride Channel (O-ClC) Family (TC 1.A.12)
CC  Proteins of the O-ClC family are voltage-sensitive chloride channels found in intracellular membranes but not the plasma membranes of animal cells. They are
CC  found in human nuclear membranes, and the bovine protein targets to the microsomes, but not the plasma membrane, when expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes.
CC  These proteins are thought to function in the regulation of the membrane potential and in transepithelial ion absorption and secretion in the kidney.
