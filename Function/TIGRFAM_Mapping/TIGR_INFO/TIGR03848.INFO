CC  A three-gene system broadly conserved among the Actinobacteria includes MSMEG_4193 and homologs, a subgroup among the larger phosphoglycerate mutase family protein (PF00300). Another member of the trio is a probable kinase, related to phosphatidylinositol kinases; that context supports the hypothesis that this protein acts as a phosphomutase.
