CC  Members of this protein family are conserved hypothetical proteins with a limited species distribution within the Gammaproteobacteria. It is common in the genera Vibrio and Shewanella, and in this resembles the C-terminal domain and putative protein sorting motif TIGR03501. This model, but design, does not extend to all homologs,but rather represents a particular clade.
