CC  Members of this subfamily of MIO prosthetic group enzymes are phenylalanine ammonia-lyases. They are found, so far, in plants and fungi. From phenylalanine, this enzyme yields cinnaminic acid, a precursor of many important plant compounds. This protein shows extensive homology to histidine ammonia-lyase, the first enzyme of a histidine degradation pathway. Note that members of this family from plant species that synthesize taxol are actually phenylalanine aminomutase, and are covered by exception model TIGR04473.
