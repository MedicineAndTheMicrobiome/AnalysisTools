CC  A comparative genome analysis of all sequenced genomes of shows a number of proteins conserved strictly among the endospore-forming subset of the Firmicutes. This protein, also called YyaC, is a member of that panel and is otherwise uncharacterized. The second round of PSI-BLAST shows many similarities to the germination protease GPR, which is found in exactly the same set of organisms and has a known role in the sporulation/germination process.
