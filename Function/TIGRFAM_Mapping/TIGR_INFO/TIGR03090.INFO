CC  This protein family is restricted to a subset of endospore-forming bacteria such as Bacillus subtilis, all of which are in the Firmicutes (low-GC Gram-positive) lineage. Although previously designated tlp (thioredoxin-like protein), the B. subtilis protein was shown to be a minor small acid-soluble spore protein SASP, unique to spores. The motif E[VIL]XDE near the C-terminus probably represents at a germination protease cleavage site.
