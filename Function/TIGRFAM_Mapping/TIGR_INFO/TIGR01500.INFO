CC  This HMM describes sepiapterin reductase, a member of the short chain dehydrogenase/reductase family. The enzyme catalyzes the last step in the biosynthesis of tetrahydrobiopterin. A similar enzyme in Bacillus cereus was isolated for its ability to convert benzil to (S)-benzoin, a property sepiapterin reductase also shares. Cutoff scores for this model are set such that benzil reductase scores between trusted and noise cutoffs.
