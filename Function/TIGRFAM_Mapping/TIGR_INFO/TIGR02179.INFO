CC  A number of anaerobic and microaerophilic species lack pyruvate dehydrogenase and have instead a four subunit, oxygen-sensitive pyruvate oxidoreductase, with either ferredoxins or flavodoxins used as the acceptor. Several related four-subunit enzymes may exist in the same species. This model describes a subfamily of delta subunits, representing mostly pyruvate, 2-ketoisovalerate, and 2-oxoglutarate  specific enzymes. The delta subunit is the smallest and resembles ferredoxins.
