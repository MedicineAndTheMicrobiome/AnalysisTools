CC  DNA repair of double-stranded breaks by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) is accomplished by a two-protein system that is present in a minority of prokaryotes. One component is the Ku protein (see TIGR02772), which binds DNA ends. The other is a DNA ligase, a protein that is a multidomain polypeptide in most of those bacteria that have NHEJ, a permuted polypeptide in Mycobacterium tuberculosis and a few other species, and the product of tandem genes in some other bacteria. This model represents the ligase domain.
