CC  This HMM respresents the oxidative cyclase responsible for forming the distinctive E-ring of the chlorin ring system under aerobic conditions [1].  This enzyme is believed to utilize a binuclear iron center and molecular oxygen.  There are two isoforms of this enzyme in some plants and cyanobacterai which are differentially regulated based on the levels of copper and oxygen [2,3].  This step is essential in the biosynthesis of both bacteriochlorophyll and chlorophyll under aerobic conditions (a separate enzyme, BchE, acts under anaerobic conditions).  This enzyme is found in plants, cyanobacteria and other photosynthetic bacteria.
