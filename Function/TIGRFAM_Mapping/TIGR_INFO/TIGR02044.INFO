CC  This HMM represents the copper-, silver- and gold- (I) responsive transcriptional activator of the gamma proteobacterial copper efflux system [1].  This protein is a member of the MerR family of transcriptional activators (PF00376) and contains a distinctive pattern of cysteine residues in its metal binding loop, Cys-X7-Cys.  This family also lacks a conserved cysteine at the N-terminal end of the dimerization helix which is required for the binding of divalent metals such as zinc; here it is replaced by a serine residue [2].
