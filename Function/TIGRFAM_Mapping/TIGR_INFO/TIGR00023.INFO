CC  This HMM represents the full length of acylphosphate:glycerol 3-phosphate acyltransferase, and integral membrane protein about 200 amino acids in length, called PlsY in Streptococcus pneumoniae, YneS in Bacillus subtilis, and YgiH in E. coli. It is found in a single copy in a large number of bacteria, including the Mycoplasmas but not Mycobacteria or spirochetes, for example. Its partner is PlsX (see TIGR00182), and the pair can replace PlsB for synthesizing 1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate.
