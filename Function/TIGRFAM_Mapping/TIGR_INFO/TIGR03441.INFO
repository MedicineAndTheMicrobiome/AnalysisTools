CC  Members of this protein family are bacterial urea transporters, found not only is species that contain urease, but adjacent to the urease operon. It was characterized in Yersinia pseudotuberculosis. Members are homologous to eukaryotic members of solute carrier family 14, a family that includes urea transporters, and to bacterial proteins in species with no detectable urea degradation system.
