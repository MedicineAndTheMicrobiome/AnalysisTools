CC  The Resistance-Nodulation-Cell Division (RND) Superfamily- MmpL sub family (TC 2.A.6.5)
CC  Characterized members of the RND superfamily all probably catalyze substrate efflux via an H+ antiport mechanism. These proteins are found ubiquitously in bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. This sub-family includes the S. coelicolor ActII3 protein, which may play a role in drug resistance, and the M. tuberculosis MmpL7 protein, which catalyzes export of an outer membrane lipid, phthiocerol dimycocerosate.
