CC  This model represents a protein subfamily that includes the cocaine esterase CocE, several glutaryl-7-ACA acylases, and the putative diester hydrolase NonD of Streptomyces griseus (all hydrolases). This family shows extensive, low-level similarity to a family of xaa-pro dipeptidyl-peptidases, and local similarity by PSI-BLAST to many other hydrolases.
