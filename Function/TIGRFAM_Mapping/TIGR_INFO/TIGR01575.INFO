CC  Members of this model belong to the GCN5-related N-acetyltransferase (GNAT) superfamily. This model covers prokarotes and the archaea. The seed contains a characterized accession for Gram negative E. coli [1]. An untraceable characterized accession (PIR|S66013) for  Gram positive B. subtilis scores well (205.0) in the full alignment. Characterized members are lacking in the archaea. Noise cutoff (72.4) was set to exclude M. loti paralog of rimI. Trusted cutoff (80.0) was set at next highest scoring member in the mini-database.
