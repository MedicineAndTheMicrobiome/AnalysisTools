CC  This model describes the Drosophila protein Pelota, the budding yeast protein DOM34 which it can replace, and a set of closely related archaeal proteins. Members contain a proposed RNA binding motif. The meiotic defect in pelota mutants may be a complex result of a protein translation defect, as suggested in yeast by ribosomal protein RPS30A being a multicopy suppressor and by an altered polyribosome profile in DOM34 mutants rescued by RPS30A. This family is homologous to a family of peptide chain release factors. Pelota is proposed to act in protein translation.
