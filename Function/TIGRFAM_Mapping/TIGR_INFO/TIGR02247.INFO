CC  This HMM represents a small clade of sequences including C. elegans and mammalian sequences as well as a small number of bacteria.  In eukaryotes, this domain exists as an N-terminal fusion to the soluble epoxide hydrolase enzyme and has recently been shown to be an active phosphatase, although the nature of the biological substrate is unclear [1].
CC  These appear to be members of the haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily of aspartate-nucleophile hydrolases by general homology and the conservation of all of the recognized catalytic motifs [2] (although the first motif is unusual in the replacement of the more common aspartate with glycine...).  The variable domain is found in between motifs 1 and 2, indicating membership in subfamily I and phylogeny and prediction of the alpha helical nature of the variable domain (by PSI-PRED) indicate membership in subfamily IA.
