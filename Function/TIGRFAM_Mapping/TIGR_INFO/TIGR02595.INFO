CC  This model describes a 25-residue domain that includes a near-invariant Pro-Glu-Pro (PEP) motif, a thirteen residue strongly hydrophobic sequence likely to span the membrane, and a five-residue strongly basic motif that often contains four Arg residues. In nearly every case, this motif is found within nine residues, and usually within five residues, of the extreme C-terminus of the protein. Proteins with this motif typically have signal sequences at the N-terminus. This region appears many times per genome or not at all, and co-occurs in genomes with a proposed protein-sorting integral membrane protein we designate exosortase (see TIGR02602). PEP-CTERM proteins frequently are poorly conserved, Ser/Thr-rich proteins and may become extensively modified proteinaceous constituents of extracellular material in bacterial biofilms.
