CC  This HAD superfamily includes including YjjG from E. coli and YfnB from B. subtilis. YjjG has been shown to act as a house-cleaning enzyme, cleaving nucleotides with non-canonical nucleotide bases. This family is a member of the haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily of hydrolases which are characterized by three conserved sequence motifs [2].  By virtue of an alpha helical domain in-between the first and second conserved motif, this family is a member of subfamily IA (TIGR01549).
