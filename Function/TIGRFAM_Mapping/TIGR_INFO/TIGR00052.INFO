CC  Members of this family include proteins of about 200 amino acids, including the recently characterized nudix hydrolase YffH, shows to be highly active as a GDP-mannose pyrophosphatase. It also includes the C-terminal half of a 361-amino acid protein, TrgB from Rhodobacter sphaeroides, shown experimentally to help confer tellurite resistance. This HMM also hits a region near the C-terminus of a 1092-amino acid protein of C. elegans.
