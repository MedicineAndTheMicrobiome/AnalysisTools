CC  This HMM describes a clade of sequences limited to the gamma proteobacteria.  This group is a member of the haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily of aspartate-dependent hydrolases and all of the conserved catalytic motifs are present [1].  Although structurally similar to subfamily IA in that the variable domain is predicted to consist of five consecutive alpha helices (by PSI-PRED), it is sufficiently divergent to warrant being regarded as a separate sub-family (IF).
CC  The gene name comes from the E. coli gene.  There is currently no information regarding the function of this gene.
