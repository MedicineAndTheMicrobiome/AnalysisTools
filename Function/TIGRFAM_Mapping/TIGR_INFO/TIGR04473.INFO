CC  Members of this family are the phenylalanine aminomutase known from taxol biosynthesis. This enzyme has the MIO prosthetic group (4-methylideneimidazole-5-one), derived from an Ala-Ser-Gly motif. Other MIO enzymes include Phe, Tyr, and His ammonia-lyases. This model serves as an exception to overrule assignments by equivalog model TIGR01226 for phenylalanine ammonia-lyase.
