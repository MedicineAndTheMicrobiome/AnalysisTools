CC  IscR (TIGR02010) is an iron-sulfur cluster-binding transcriptional regulator (see Genome Property GenProp0138). Members of this protein family include YhgI, whose expression is under control of IscR, and show sequence similarity to IscA, a known protein of iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis. These two lines of evidence strongly suggest a role as an iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis protein. An older study designated this protein GntY and suggested a role for it and for the product of an adjacent gene, based on complementation studies, in gluconate utilization.
