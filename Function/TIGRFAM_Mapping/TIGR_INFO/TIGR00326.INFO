CC  This HMM describes the ribD protein as found in Escherichia coli. The N-terminal domain includes the conserved zinc-binding site region captured in the HMM dCMP_cyt_deam and shared by proteins such as cytosine deaminase, mammalian apolipoprotein B mRNA editing protein, blasticidin-S deaminase, and Bacillus subtilis competence protein comEB. The C-terminal domain is homologous to the full length of yeast HTP reductase, a protein required for riboflavin biosynthesis. A number of archaeal proteins believed related to riboflavin biosynthesis contain only this C-terminal domain and are not found as full-length matches to this model.
