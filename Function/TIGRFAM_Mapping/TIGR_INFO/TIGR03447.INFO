CC  Members of this protein family are MshC, l-cysteine:1-D-myo-inosityl 2-amino-2-deoxy-alpha-D-glucopyranoside ligase, an enzyme that uses ATP to ligate a Cys residue to a mycothiol precursor molecule, in the second to last step in mycothiol biosynthesis. This enzyme shows considerable homology to Cys--tRNA ligases, and many instances are misannotated as such. Mycothiol is found in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Corynebacterium glutamicum, Streptomyces coelicolor, and various other members of the Actinobacteria. Mycothiol is an analog to glutathione.
