CC  This model describes orthologs of the recA protein. RecA promotes hybridization of homolgous regions of DNA. A segment of ssDNA can be hybridized to another ssDNA region, or to a dsDNA region. ATP is hydrolyzed in the process. Part of the SOS respones, it is regulated by LexA via autocatalytic cleavage.
