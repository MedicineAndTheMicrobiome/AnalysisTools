CC  Members of this protein family are found exclusively, although not universally, in bacterial species that possess a type VI secretion system. Genes are found in type VI secretion-associated gene clusters. The specific function is unknown. This model represents the rather well-conserved amino-terminal domain of a protein family in which carboxy-terminal regions, when present, show little conservation.
