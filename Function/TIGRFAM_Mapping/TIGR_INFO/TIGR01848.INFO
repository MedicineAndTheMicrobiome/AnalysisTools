CC  Poly-B-hydroxyalkanoates are lipidlike carbon/energy storage polymers found in granular inclusions. PhaR is a regulatory protein found in general near other proteins associated with polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) granule biosynthesis and utilization. It is found to be a DNA-binding homotetramer that is also capable of binding short chain hydroxyalkanoic acids and PHA granules. PhaR may regulate the expression of itself, of the phasins that coat granules, and of enzymes that direct carbon flux into polymers stored in granules. The C-terminal region is poorly conserved in this family and is not part of this model.//GO terms added 12/6/04 [SS]
