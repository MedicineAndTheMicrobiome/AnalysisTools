CC  This HMM represents the histidinol phosphate phosphatase HisJ of Bacillus subtilis, and related proteins from a number of species within a larger family of phosphatases in the PHP hydrolase family. HisJ catalyzes the penultimate step of histidine biosynthesis but shows no homology to the functionally equivalent sequence in E. coli, a domain of the bifunctional HisB protein. Note, however, that many species have two members and that Clostridium perfringens, predicted not to make histidine, has five members of this family; this family is designated subfamily rather than equivalog to indicate that members may not all act as HisJ.

RT  Histidinol phosphate phosphatase, catalyzing the penultimate step of the histidine biosynthesis pathway, is encoded by ytvP (hisJ) in Bacillus subtilis.
