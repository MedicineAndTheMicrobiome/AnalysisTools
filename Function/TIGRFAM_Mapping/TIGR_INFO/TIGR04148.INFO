EN  radical SAM peptide maturase, GG-Bacteroidales family
TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  Members of this protein family are radical SAM enzymes (PF04055) with the additional C-terminal region (TIGR04085) that is frequently a marker of peptide modification. Many members of this family are found in the vicinity of one or several ORFs encoding short polypeptides with a Gly-Gly motif (common for bacteriocin leader peptide cleavage), followed by a Cys-rich patch and then poorly conserved sequences.
