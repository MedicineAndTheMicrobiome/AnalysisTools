CC  This HMM describes a protein family about 200 amino acids in length with only five invariant residues, including an Arg, a Ser-Asp pair, and two Gly residues. Members always are found exclusively in Actinobacteria, and always adjacent to homologs of TadA, a tRNA-specific adenosine deaminase from Escherichia coli. Homology, phyletic pattern, and gene neighborhood together suggest a housekeeping function in tRNA metabolism.
