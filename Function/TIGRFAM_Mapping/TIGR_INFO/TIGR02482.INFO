CC  6-phosphofructokinase (EC 2.7.1.11) catalyzes the addition of phosphate from ATP to fructose 6-phosphate to give fructose 1,6-bisphosphate.  This represents a key control step in glycolysis.  This model hits bacterial ATP-dependent 6-phosphofructokinases which lack a beta-hairpin loop present in TIGR02483 family members. TIGR02483 contains members that are ATP-dependent as well as members that are pyrophosphate-dependent. TIGR02477 represents the pyrophosphate-dependent phosphofructokinase, diphosphate--fructose-6-phosphate 1-phosphotransferase (EC 2.7.1.90).
