CC  This model represents one branch of COG0042 (Predicted TIM-barrel enzymes, possibly dehydrogenases, nifR3 family). This branch includes NifR3 itself, from Rhodobacter capsulatus. It excludes a broadly distributed but more sparsely populated subfamily that contains sll0926 from Synechocystis PCC6803, HI0634 from Haemophilus influenzae, and BB0225 from Borrelia burgdorferi. It also excludes a shorter and more distant archaeal subfamily.
CC  The function of nifR3, a member of this family, is unknown, but it is found in an operon with nitrogen-sensing two component regulators in  Rhodobacter capsulatus.
CC  Members of this family show a distant relationship to alpha/beta (TIM) barrel enzymes such as dihydroorotate dehydrogenase and glycolate oxidase.
