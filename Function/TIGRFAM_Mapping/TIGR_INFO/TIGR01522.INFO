CC  This model describes the P-type ATPase responsible for translocating calcium ions across the golgi membrane of fungi and animals [1,2], and is of particular importance in the sarcoplasmic reticulum of skeletal and cardiac muscle in vertebrates [2]. 
CC  The calcium P-type ATPases have been characterized as Type IIA based on a phylogenetic analysis which distinguishes this group from the Type IIB PMCA calcium pump [3] modelled by TIGR01517.  A separate analysis divides Type IIA into sub-types, SERCA and PMR1 [2] the former of which is modelled by TIGR01116.
