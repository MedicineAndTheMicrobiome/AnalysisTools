CC  Members of this protein family are encoded by one of two consecutive genes for SPASM domain proteins. The two are closely homologous in the SPASM domain regions, and also in a small N-terminal region, but the other family (TIGR04303) has an intact radical SAM domain (PF04055) that this "quasi-rSAM" protein lacks. A PqqD-family protein, TIGR04302, is always adjacent.
