CC  This tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase model starts picking up tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetases at scores of 0 and below. The proteins found by this model have a deep split between two groups. One group contains bacterial and organellar eukaryotic examples. The other contains archaeal and cytosolic eukaryotic examples.
