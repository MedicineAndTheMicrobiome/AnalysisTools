CC  Members of this protein family are sortase enzymes, cysteine transpeptidases involved in protein sorting activities. Members of this family tend to be found in proteobacteria, rather than in Gram-positive bacteria where sortases attach proteins to the Gram-positive cell wall or participate in pilin cross-linking. Many species with this sortase appear to contain a signal target sequence, a protein with a Vault protein inter-alpha-trypsin domain (PF08487) and a von Willebrand factor type A domain (PF00092), encoded by an adjacent gene. These sortases are designated subfamily 6 according to Comfort and Clubb (2004).
