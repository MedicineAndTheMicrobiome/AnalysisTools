CC  All proteins in this family for which functions are known bind ssDNA and are involved in the the pairing of homologous DNA
CC  This family is based on the phylogenomic analysis of JA Eisen (1999, Ph.D. Thesis, Stanford University). RecT and homologs are found in prophage regions of bacterial genomes. RecT works with a partner protein, RecE.
