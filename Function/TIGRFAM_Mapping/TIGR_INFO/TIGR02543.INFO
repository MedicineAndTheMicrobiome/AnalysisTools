CC  This model describes a conserved core region, about 43 residues in length, of at least two families of tandem repeats. These include 78-residue repeats from 2 to 15 in number, in some proteins of Bacteroides forsythus ATCC 43037, and 70-residue repeats in families of internalins of Listeria species. Single copies are found in proteins of  Fibrobacter succinogenes, Geobacter sulfurreducens, and a few bacteria.
