CC  Members of this family are uncharacterized proteins, including YtoQ from Bacillus subtilis. This family shows some sequence similarity to a family of nucleoside 2-deoxyribosyltransferases (COG3613 as iterated through CDD), but sufficiently remote that PSI-BLAST starting from YtoQ and exploring outwards does not discover the relationship.
