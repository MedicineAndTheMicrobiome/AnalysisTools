CC  This model represents a distinctive clade, in which all characterized members are FMN-binding, within the larger family of luciferase-like monooxygenases (LLM), among which there are both FMN- and F420-binding enzymes. A well-characterized member is nitrilotriacetate monooxygenase from Aminobacter aminovorans (Chelatobacter heintzii), where nitrilotriacetate is a chelating agent used in detergents.
