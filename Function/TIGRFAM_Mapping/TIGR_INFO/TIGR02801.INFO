CC  The model describes the inner membrane protein TolR, part of the TolR/TolQ complex that transduces energy from the proton-motive force, through TolA, to an outer membrane complex made up of TolB and Pal (peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein). The complex is required to maintain outer membrane integrity, and defects may cause a defect in the import of some organic compounds in addition to the resulting morphologic. While several gene pairs homologous to talR and tolQ may be found in a single genome, but the scope of this model is set to favor finding only bone fide TolR, supported by operon structure as well as by score.
