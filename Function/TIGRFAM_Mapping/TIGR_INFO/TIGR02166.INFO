CC  Members of this family include known and probable dimethyl sulfoxide reductase (DMSO reductase) A chains. In E. coli, dmsA encodes the canonical anaerobic DMSO reductase A chain. The paralog ynfE, as part of ynfFGH expressed from a multicopy plasmid, could complement a dmsABC deletion, suggesting a similar function and some overlap in specificity, although YnfE could not substitute for DmsA in a mixed complex.
