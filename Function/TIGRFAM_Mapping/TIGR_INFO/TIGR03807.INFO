CC  This model describes a small repeat found in a family of proteins that crosses the plasma membrane by twin-arginine translation, which usually signifies the presence of a bound cofactor. This repeat shows similarity to the beta-helical repeat, in which three beta-strands per repeat wind once per repeat around in a right-handed helical stack of parallel beta structure.
