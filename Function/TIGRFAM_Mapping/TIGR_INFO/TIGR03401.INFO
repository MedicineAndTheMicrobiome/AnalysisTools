CC  Members of this protein family are known, so far, in the Ascomycota, a branch of the Fungi, and contain an HD domain (PF01966), found typically in various metal-dependent phosphohydrolases. The only characterized member of this family, from the soil fungus Myrothecium verrucaria, is cyanamide hydratase (EC 4.2.1.69), a zinc-containing homohexamer that adds water to the fertilizer cyanamide (NCNH2), a nitrile compound, to produce urea (NH2-CO-NH2). Homologs are likely to be nitrile hydratases.
