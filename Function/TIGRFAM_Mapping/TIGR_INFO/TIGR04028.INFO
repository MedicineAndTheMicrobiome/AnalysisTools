TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  Members of this protein family are ABC transporter substrate-binding proteins related to KPN_01854 from Klebsiella pneumoniae, and occur in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative species. This transport protein family is closely associated with a putative FMN-dependent luciferase-like monooxygenase of unknown function (TIGR04027), as well as with the other proteins of its transporter complex.
