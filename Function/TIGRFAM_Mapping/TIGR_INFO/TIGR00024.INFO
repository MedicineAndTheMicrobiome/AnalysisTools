CC  Members of this uncharacterized family share a motif approximating DXH(X25)GDXXD(X25)GNHD as found in several phosphoesterases, including the nucleases SbcD and Mre11. SbcD is a subunit of the SbcCD nuclease of E. coli that can cleave DNA hairpins to unblock stalled DNA replication. All members of this family are archaeal.
RM  9653124
RT  The SbcCD nuclease of Escherichia coli is a structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) family protein that cleaves hairpin DNA.
