CC  This model represents the M42.001 clade within MEROPS family M42. M42 includes glutamyl aminopeptidase as in the present model, deblocking aminopeptidases as from Pyrococcus horikoshii and related species, and endo-1,4-beta-glucanase (cellulase M) as from Clostridium thermocellum. The current family includes
