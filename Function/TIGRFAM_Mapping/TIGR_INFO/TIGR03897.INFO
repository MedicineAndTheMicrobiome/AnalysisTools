CC  Members of this family are known generally as LanM, a multifunctional enzyme of lantibiotic biosynthesis. This catalysis by LanM distinguishes the type 2 lantibiotics, such as mersacidin, cinnamycin, and lichenicidin, from LanBC-produced type 1 lantibiotics such as nisin and subtilin. The N-terminal domain contains regions associated with Ser and Thr dehydration. The C-terminal region contains a PF05147 domain, which catalyzes the formation of the lanthionine bridge.
