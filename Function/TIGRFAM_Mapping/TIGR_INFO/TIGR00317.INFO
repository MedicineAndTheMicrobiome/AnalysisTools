CC  cobS is involved with  cobalamin biosynthesis in part III of colbalmin biosynthesis. The enzyme catyalzes the reactions adenosylcobinamide-GDP + alpha-ribazole-5'-P = adenosylcobalamin-5'-phosphate + GMP and adenosylcobinamide-GDP + alpha-ribazole = adenosylcobalamin + GMP. The protein product is associated with a large complex of proteins and is induced by cobinamide.
