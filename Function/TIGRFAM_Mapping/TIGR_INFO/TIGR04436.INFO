CC  This family, related to streptomycin biosynthesis protein StrG and to phytanoyl-CoA dioxygenase, belongs to the 2-oxoglutarate and Fe(II)-dependent oxygenase clan, which includes not just dioxygenases such as phytanoyl-CoA dioxygenase PhyH, but also some chlorinating enzymes involved in natural product biosynthesis. Members of this family occur so far only in O-antigen biosynthesis regions of select Leptospira, and include an ~80 residue additional C-terminal region shared by no other proteins.
