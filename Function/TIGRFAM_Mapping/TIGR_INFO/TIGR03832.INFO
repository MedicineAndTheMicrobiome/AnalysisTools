CC  Members of this protein family are tyrosine 2,3-aminomutase. It is variable from member to member as to whether the (R)-beta-Tyr or (S)-beta-Tyr is the preferred product from L-Tyr. This enzyme tends to occur in secondary metabolite biosynthesis systems, as in the production of chondramides in Chondromyces crocatus.
