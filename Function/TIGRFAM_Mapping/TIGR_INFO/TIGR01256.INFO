CC  The model describes the molybdate ABC transporter periplasmic binding protein in bacteria and archae. Several of the periplasmic receptors constitute a diverse class of binding proteins that differ widely in size, sequence and ligand specificity. It has been shown experimentally by radioactive labeling that ModA represent hydrophylioc periplasmic-binding protein in gram-negative organisms and its counterpart in gram-positive organisms is a lipoprotein. The other components of the system include the ModB, an integral membrane protein and ModC the ATP-binding subunit. Invariably almost all of them display a common beta/alpha folding motif and have similar tertiary structures consisting of two globular domains.
