CC  Two groups of proteins form acetolactate from two molecules of pyruvate. The type of acetolactate synthase described in this model also catalyzes the formation of acetohydroxybutyrate from pyruvate and 2-oxobutyrate, an early step in the branched chain amino acid biosynthesis; it is therefore also termed  acetohydroxyacid synthase.
CC  In bacteria, this catalytic chain is associated with a smaller regulatory chain in an alpha2/beta2 heterotetramer. 
CC  Acetolactate synthase is a thiamine pyrophosphate enzyme. In this type, FAD and Mg++ are also found.
CC  Several isozymes of this enzyme are found in E. coli K12, one of which contains a frameshift in the large subunit gene and is not expressed.
