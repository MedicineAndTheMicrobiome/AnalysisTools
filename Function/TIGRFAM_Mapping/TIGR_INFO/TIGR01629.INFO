CC  This HMM represents a family of phage and plasmid replication proteins. In bacteriophage IKe and related phage, the full-length protein is designated gene II protein. A much shorter protein of unknown function, translated from a conserved in-frame alternative initiator, is designated gene X protein. Members of this family also include plasmid replication proteins. This model is built as a fragment model to better detect translations from alternate intiators and other fragments relative to full length gene II protein.
