CC  This model describes the vacuolar ATP synthase G subunit in eukaryotes and includes members from diverse groups e.g., fungi, plants, parasites etc. V-ATPases are multi-subunit enzymes composed of two functional domains: A transmembrane Vo domain and a peripheral catalytic domain V1. The G subunit is one of the subunits of the catalytic domain. V-ATPases are responsible for the acidification of endosomes and lysosomes, which are part of the central vacuolar system.
