CC  This HMM represents the eukaryotic glutathione synthetase, which shows little resemblance to the analogous enzyme of Gram-negative bacteria (TIGR01380). In the Kinetoplastida, trypanothione replaces glutathione, but can be made from glutathione; a sequence from Leishmania is not included in the seed, is highly divergent, and therefore scores between the trusted and noise cutoffs.
