CC  A member of this family, AcpA from Burkholderia mallei, has been charactized as a surface-bound glycoprotein with acid phosphatase activity, as can be shown with the colorigenic substrate 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate. This family shares regions of sequence similarity with phosphocholine-preferring phospholipase C enzymes (TIGR03396) from many of the same species.
