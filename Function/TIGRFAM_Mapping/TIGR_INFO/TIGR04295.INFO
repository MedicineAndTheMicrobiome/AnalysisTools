CC  A variety of bacteria, including multiple species of  Bradyrhizobium, Mesorhizobium, and Methylobacterium, have a typically twelve-gene cassette (hence the designation rhizo-twelve) for the biosynthesis of some unknown oligosaccaride. This family is a B12-binding domain/radical SAM domain protein found in roughly have of these cassettes, but nowhere else.
