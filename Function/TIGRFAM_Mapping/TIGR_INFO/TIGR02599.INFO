CC  This family consists sets of paralogous family of proteins in the Verrucomicrobium spinosum and Chthoniobacter flavus. All members contain the  prepilin-type N-terminal cleavage/methylation domain (TIGR02532) at the N-terminus. The mature protein would be about 350 amino acids long. These proteins occur in the four-gene Verru_Chthon cassette, in which two other genes likewise encode a cleavage/methylation domain. Most of these cassettes occur next to an unusually large PEP-CTERM protein with an autotransporter domain.
