CC  Members of this protein family are found exclusively in genomes that contain putative set of labile selenium-dependent enzyme accessory proteins as well as homologs of a labile selenium-dependent purine hydroxylase. A mutant in this gene in Escherichia coli had improved stationary phase viability. The function is unknown.
