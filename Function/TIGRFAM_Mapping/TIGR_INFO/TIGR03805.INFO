CC  Members of this protein family contain a tandem pair of beta-helix repeats (see TIGR03804). Each repeat is expected to consist of three beta strands that form a single turn as they form a right-handed helix of stacked beta-structure. Member proteinsa occur regularly in two-gene pairs along with another uncharacterized protein family; both protein families exhibit either lipoprotein or regular signal peptides, suggesting transit through the plasma membrane, and the two may be fused. The function of the pair is unknown.
