CC  This protein family is one of several observed in species that express bacillithiol, an analog of glutathione and mycothiol. Rather than being involved in bacillithiol biosynthesis, members are likely to act in bacillithiol-dependent processes. A suggested term is bacilliredoxin (a glutaredoxin-like thiol-dependent oxidoreductase), and a suggested role of YphP is de-bacillithiolation - removing bacillithiol that became linked to protein thiols under oxidative stress. An older description of YphP as a disulphide isomerase therefore may be wrong.
