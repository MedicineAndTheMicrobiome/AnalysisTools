CC  This rare conserved hypothetical protein of small size occurs exclusively, and perhaps universally, in the context of a pair of (uncharacterized) radical SAM proteins, TIGR03977 and TIGR03978. Many members of this family have invariant motifs LYW and LLNDYxLRE, but PSI-BLAST starting from family members well below 20 % pairwise sequence identity to this group eventually brings in the entire family as modeled here. The family TIGR03979 represents the fourth regularly conserved member of this system.
