CC  In most bacteria, a single bifunctional protein catalyses phosphopantothenoylcysteine decarboxylase and phosphopantothenate--cysteine ligase activities, sequential steps in coenzyme A biosynthesis (see TIGR00521). These activities reside in separate proteins encoded by tandem genes in some bacterial lineages. This model describes proteins from the genera Streptococcus and Enterococcus homologous to the C-terminal region of TIGR00521, corresponding to phosphopantothenate--cysteine ligase activity.
