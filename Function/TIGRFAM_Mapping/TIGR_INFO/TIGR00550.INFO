CC  This protein, termed NadA, plays a role in the synthesis of pyridine, a precursor to NAD. The quinolinate synthetase complex consists of A protein (this protein) and B protein. B protein converts L-aspartate to iminoaspartate, an unstable reaction product which in the absence of A protein is spontaneously hydrolyzed to form oxaloacetate. The A protein, NadA, converts iminoaspartate to quinolate.
