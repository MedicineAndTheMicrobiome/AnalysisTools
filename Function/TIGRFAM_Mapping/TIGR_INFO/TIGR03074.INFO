CC  This protein family has a phylogenetic distribution very similar to that coenzyme PQQ biosynthesis enzymes, as shown by partial phylogenetic profiling. Members of this family have several predicted transmembrane helices in the N-terminal region, and include the quinoprotein glucose dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.5.2) of Escherichia coli and the quinate/shikimate dehydrogenase of Acinetobacter sp. ADP1 (EC 1.1.99.25). Sequences closely related except for the absense of the N-terminal hydrophobic region, scoring in the gray zone between the trusted and noise cutoffs, include PQQ-dependent glycerol (EC 1.1.99.22) and and other polyol (sugar alcohol) dehydrogenases.
