CC  This protein was described initially as an inhibitor of protein synthesis intiation, then as an endoribonuclease active on single-stranded mRNA, endoribonuclease L-PSP. Members of this family, conserved in all domains of life and often with several members per bacterial genome, appear to catalyze a reaction that minimizes toxic by-products from reactions catalyzed by pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enzymes.
