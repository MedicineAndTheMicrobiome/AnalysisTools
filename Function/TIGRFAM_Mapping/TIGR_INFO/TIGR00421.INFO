CC  In E.coli, the protein UbiX (3-octaprenyl-4-hydroxybenzoate carboxy-lyase) has been shown to be involved in the third step of ubiquinone biosynthesis. It catalyzes the reaction [3-octaprenyl-4-hydroxybenzoate = 2-octaprenylphenol + CO2]. The knockout of the homologous protein in yeast confers sensitivity to phenylacrylic acid. Members are not restricted to ubiquinone-synthesizing species. This family represents a distinct clade within the flavoprotein family of Pfam model PF02441.
