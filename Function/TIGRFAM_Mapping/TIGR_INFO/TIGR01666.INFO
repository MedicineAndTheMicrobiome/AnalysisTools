CC  This model represents a clade of sequences from gamma and beta proteobacteria.  These proteins are >700 amino acids long and many have been annotated as putative membrane proteins.  The gene from Salmonella has been annotated as a putative efflux transporter.  The gene from E. coli has the name yccS.
