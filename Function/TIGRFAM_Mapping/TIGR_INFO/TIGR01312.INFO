CC  This HMM describes D-xylulose kinases, a subfamily of the FGGY family of carbohydrate kinases. The member from Klebsiella pneumoniae, designated DalK (see PMID:9324246), was annotated erroneously in GenBank as D-arabinitol kinase but is authentic D-xylulose kinase.
CC  D-xylulose kinase (XylB) generally is found with xylose isomerase (XylA) and acts in xylose utilization.
