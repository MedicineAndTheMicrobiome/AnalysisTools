CC  Members of this family are RlmN, a 23S rRNA m2A2503 methyltransferase in the radical SAM enzyme family. Closely related is Cfr, a Staphylococcus sciuri plasmid-borne homolog to this family, Cfr, has been identified as essential to transferrable resistance to chloramphenicol and florfenicol. Cfr methylates 23S RNA at a different site.
