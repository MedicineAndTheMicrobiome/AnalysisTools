CC  Members of this protein family include the B subunit, one of three subunits, of the anaerobic sulfite reductase of Salmonella, and close homologs from various Clostridum species, where the three-gene neighborhood is preserved. Two such gene clusters are found in Clostridium perfringens, but it may be that these sets of genes correspond to the distinct assimilatory and dissimilatory forms as seen in Clostridium pasteurianum.
