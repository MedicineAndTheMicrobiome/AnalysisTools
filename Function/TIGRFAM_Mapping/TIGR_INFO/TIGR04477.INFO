EN  XrtN system VIT domain protein
TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  Members of this subfamily average about 850 amino acids in length, ending with a variant form of PEP-CTERM sorting signal. Members have a VIT (vault protein inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain) domain (PF08487). Other bacterial subfamilies of VIT domain proteins have members with either GlyGly-CTERM or LPXTG C-terminal sorting signals. Members of this subfamily occur only in context next to a protein sorting/processing enzyme, exosortase N (XrtN). These subsystems occur both among the Bacteriodetes and in the spirochete genus Leptospira.
