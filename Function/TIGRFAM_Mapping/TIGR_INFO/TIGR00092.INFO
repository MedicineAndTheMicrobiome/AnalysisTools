CC  This predicted GTP-binding protein is found in a single copy in every complete bacterial genome, and is found in Eukaryotes. A more distantly related protein, separated from this model, is found in the archaea. It is known to bind GTP and double-stranded nucleic acid. It is suggested to belong to a nucleoprotein complex and act as a translation factor.
